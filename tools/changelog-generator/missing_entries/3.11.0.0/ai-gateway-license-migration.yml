message: |
  If any [AI Gateway plugin](/plugins/?category=ai) has been enabled in a self-managed Kong Gateway deployment for more than a week, upgrades from 3.10 versions to 3.11.0.0 will fail due to a license migration issue.
  This does not affect Konnect deployments. A fix will be provided in 3.11.0.1.

  See [breaking changes in 3.11](/gateway/breaking-changes/#known-issues-in-3-11-0-0) for a temporary workaround.
