[#11131](https://github.com/Kong/kong/pull/11131)\n\n[Kong Manager OSS](https://docs.konghq.com/gateway/latest/kong-manager-oss/) allows you to view and edit all Kong Gateway objects using the Admin API. It interacts directly with the Kong Admin API and does not require a separate database. This UI provides a great way to see all of your Kong Gateway configuration at glance.\n\nStarting with 3.4.0.0, Kong Manager OSS is bundled with Kong Gateway OSS. Install a new Kong Gateway OSS instance to try it out!\n\nThe quickest way to get started is using the [quickstart script](https://github.com/Kong/kong-manager#getting-started).\n\nCheck out the [Kong Manager OSS repo](https://github.com/Kong/kong-manager) to learn more about it.",
