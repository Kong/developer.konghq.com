Kong Gateway can then reference these secrets, making your environment more secure.\n\nThe beta includes `get` support for the following vault implementations:\n\n- [AWS Secrets Manager](https://docs.konghq.com/gateway/latest/kong-enterprise/secrets-management/backends/aws-sm/)\n- [HashiCorp Vault](https://docs.konghq.com/gateway/latest/kong-enterprise/secrets-management/backends/hashicorp-vault/)\n- [Environment variable](https://docs.konghq.com/gateway/latest/kong-enterprise/secrets-management/backends/env/)\n\nAs part of this support, some plugins have certain fields marked as_referenceable_. See the plugin section of the Kong Gateway 2.8 changelog for details.\n\nTest out secrets management using the[getting started guide](https://docs.konghq.com/gateway/latest/kong-enterprise/secrets-management/getting-started/), and check out the documentation for the Kong Admin API [`/vaults-beta` entity](https://docs.konghq.com/gateway/latest/admin-api/#vaults-beta-entity).\n\n{:.important}\n> This feature is in beta.
