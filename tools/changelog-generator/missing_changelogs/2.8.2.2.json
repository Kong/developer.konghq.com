This was causing a shortage of timers under heavy traffic and led to unpredictable consequences, where internal timers were killed randomly and couldnâ€™t recover automatically. This would then trigger a `lua_max_running_timers are not enough` timer error and cause data planes to crash.\n\n[#9521](https://github.com/Kong/kong/pull/9521)",
