# OpenAPI specs

* Konnect specs are managed through Platform API
* Gateway on-prem Admin API is generated through [kong-admin-spec-generator](https://github.com/Kong/kong-admin-spec-generator)

## Publishing a new spec

1. Check [workflow file](https://github.com/Kong/platform-api/blob/main/.github/raise-pr-on-change.json) in Platform API
to make sure the new spec is included. If not, add it the new spec to it.

1. The previous step will kick off an automatic update to the docs repo. Any public update to a spec opens a PR that looks like this: [feat(sdk): automated oas update](https://github.com/Kong/developer.konghq.com/pull/2372). 

   > Exception: If your feature isn't live but the spec is needed for an internal beta or tech preview, you need to grab the file manually.

1. Ask a PM to upload the spec to Konnect

1. Run the [Sync Konnect OAS data](https://github.com/Kong/developer.konghq.com/actions/workflows/sync-konnect-oas-data.yml) workflow and merge the generated PR.
