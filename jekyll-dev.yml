# skip generators to speed up dev builds, the name matches the generator's name
skip:
  plugins: true # skip plugins generation, except for overviews
  indices: true # skip indices
  mesh_policy: true # skip mesh policies generation, except for overviews
  event_gateway_policy: true # skip event gateway policies generation, except for overviews
  explorer: true # skip explorer
  auto_generated: true # skip auto_generated references, i.e. app/_referneces
  mesh: true # skip kuma to mesh generation

# exclude app/_references
# even though we set skip.auto_generated: true and the collection has output:false
# Jekyll still reads, parses and renders the collection. It doesn't write the pages
# to disc though, but the first part is very time consuming.
