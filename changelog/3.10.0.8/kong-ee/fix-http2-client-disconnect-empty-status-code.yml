  Fixed an issue where Kong incorrectly logged upstream status codes as 000 (or empty) when HTTP/2
  clients disconnected during response processing. This occurred when response buffering was
  enabled.
  Kong now correctly records the actual upstream status code even when the HTTP/2 client disconnects
  before receiving the complete response.
