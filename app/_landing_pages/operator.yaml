            As we continue moving suport for Kubernetes Gateway API from self-managed control planes, as well as Konnect managed control 
            planes, we will will open up support for other Konnect products when hosting your Gateway on Kubernetes.

            Providing Gateway API configuration for Kong Gateway, as well as full integration with the Konnect platform opens up the entire
            API ecosystem.

            We built Konnect CRDs after listening to _you_. Users told us that their teams are used to working in Kubernetes. They have policy 
            enforcement engines running in their clusters, and well defined review processes for CRD changes.

            Now we need your help. We're expanding CRD support to new products, and need you to tell us which APIs you want us to build first.

            Join the conversation and tell us how you're using {{ site.konnect_short_name }} CRDs today and what you'd like to see next.
