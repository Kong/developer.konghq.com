                    Mesh Manager follows a hierarchical control plane model to manage service mesh deployments across zones.

                    - **Global Control Plane**: Stores configuration and policies for all meshes.
                    - **Zone Control Planes**: Manage mesh networking and service traffic in their respective zones.
                    - **Services**: Connect to the zone Control Plane for inbound and outbound traffic control.
