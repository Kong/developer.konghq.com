                  {{site.konnect_short_name}} unifies and manages APIs, LLMs, events, and microservices with a single, centralized management plane, giving you consistent visibility and control across your entire API ecosystem.
                  It uniquely combines a control plane, managed by Kong and hosted in the cloud, with the versatility of managing the data plane on your termsâ€”either self-managed or through Kong, within your preferred network environment.

                  {{site.konnect_short_name}} can help you with the following use cases:
                  * Easily manage {{site.base_gateway}}
                  * Catalog, share, and monetize APIs
                  * Achieve federated API management with [multi-geo](/konnect-platform/geos/) support

              a: |
                When you create a {{site.konnect_saas}} account, {{site.ee_product_name}}, {{site.kic_product_name}} (KIC), and {{site.mesh_product_name}}
                licenses are automatically provisioned to your organization. You do not need to manage these
                licenses manually.

                Any data plane nodes or {{site.kic_product_name}} associations configured through the Gateway Manager
                also implicitly receive the same license from the {{site.konnect_saas}}
                control plane. You should never have to deal with a license directly.

                For any license questions, contact your sales representative.
