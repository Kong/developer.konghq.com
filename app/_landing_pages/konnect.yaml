                  {{site.konnect_short_name}} unifies and manages APIs, LLMs, events, and microservices with a single, centralized management plane, giving you consistent visibility and control across your entire API ecosystem.
                  It uniquely combines a control plane, managed by Kong and hosted in the cloud, with the versatility of managing the data plane on your terms—either self-managed or through Kong, within your preferred network environment.

                  {{site.konnect_short_name}} can help you with the following use cases:
                  * Easily manage {{site.base_gateway}}

                  The {{site.konnect_short_name}} platform runs in [hybrid mode](/gateway/hybrid-mode/) and provides several hosted control plane options to manage all service configurations.
                  The control plane propagates those configurations to the data plane group, which is composed of data plane nodes (and in the case of {{site.mesh_product_name}}, proxies).
                  The individual nodes can be running either on-premise, in cloud-hosted environments, or fully managed by {{site.konnect_short_name}}.

            - q: Can I check my {{site.konnect_short_name}} usage metrics?
              a: |

                Yes, you can check your {{site.konnect_short_name}} license usage through the **Organization** > **Plan and usage** {{site.konnect_short_name}} menu, 
                or the `/kbilling/v1/usage` endpoint of the {{site.konnect_short_name}} API.

                If using the API, pass an [access token](/konnect-api/#konnect-api-authentication) for your organization with the following command:

                 ```sh
                curl -X GET 'https://global.api.konghq.com/kbilling/v1/usage' \
                  --header 'Authorization: Bearer $KONNECT_TOKEN' -s
                ```

                You can filter the report for any particular metric. For example, the see the total number of requests:
                
                ```sh
                curl -X GET 'https://global.api.konghq.com/kbilling/v1/usage' \
                  --header 'Authorization: Bearer $KONNECT_TOKEN' -s | jq .data.us.total_request_count
                ```
