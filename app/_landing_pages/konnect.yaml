                  {{site.konnect_short_name}} unifies and manages APIs, LLMs, events, and microservices with a single, centralized management plane, giving you consistent visibility and control across your entire API ecosystem.
                  It uniquely combines a control plane, managed by Kong and hosted in the cloud, with the versatility of managing the data plane on your terms—either self-managed or through Kong, within your preferred network environment.

                  {{site.konnect_short_name}} can help you with the following use cases:
                  * Easily manage {{site.base_gateway}}
                  * Catalog, share, and monetize APIs
                  * Achieve federated API management with [multi-geo](/konnect-platform/geos/) support

                  The {{site.konnect_short_name}} platform runs in [hybrid mode](/gateway/hybrid-mode/) and provides several hosted control plane options to manage all service configurations.
                  The control plane propagates those configurations to the data plane group, which is composed of data plane nodes (and in the case of {{site.mesh_product_name}}, proxies). 
                  The individual nodes can be running either on-premise, in cloud-hosted environments, or fully managed by {{site.konnect_short_name}}.

              a: |
                When you create a {{site.konnect_saas}} account, {{site.ee_product_name}}, {{site.kic_product_name}} (KIC), and {{site.mesh_product_name}}
                licenses are automatically provisioned to your organization. You do not need to manage these
                licenses manually.

                Any data plane nodes or {{site.kic_product_name}} associations configured through the Gateway Manager
                also implicitly receive the same license from the {{site.konnect_saas}}
                control plane. You should never have to deal with a license directly.

                For any license questions, contact your sales representative.
