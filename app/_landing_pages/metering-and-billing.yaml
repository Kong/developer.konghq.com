                    {{site.konnect_short_name}} Metering and Billing provides a full system for tracking usage, creating billable products, enforcing entitlements, and generating invoices.  
                    It is designed for AI and API-first businesses that need accurate usage metering, flexible pricing models, and customer-level billing detail.

                    You can meter {{site.base_gateway}} requests, LLM tokens, or any custom event.  
                    You can define features, build pricing plans, create subscriptions, and connect customers to Stripe or other external systems.
