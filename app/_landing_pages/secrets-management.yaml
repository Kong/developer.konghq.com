                  @todo Content ideas:
                    * intro paragraph (what secrets management is, why use it, use cases)
                    * tiles to the various backends (env variables, GCP, AWS, Azure, Hashicorp, Konnect config store), links would be to their how to pages
                    * link to the Vaults entity, maybe talk about that a little somewhere
                    * Mermaid diagram that shows how it works?
                    * Small paragraph about secret rotation that links off to the secret rotation concept page
                    * what are a users options to configure this? What various pieces do they have to configure (generally) to get this to work? Ex. kong.conf, vaults entity, third-party backend, etc.
                    * explain how vault secrets can be accessed and used
