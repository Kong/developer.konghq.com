                    The {{site.konnect_short_name}} Dev Portal is a customizable website for developers to locate, access, and consume API services. 
                    It enables developers to browse and search API documentation, try API operations, and manage their own credentials. 
                    The Portal supports both internal and external APIs through flexible deployment options.

                    Dev Portal APIs allow you to publish APIs using OpenAPI specifications and Markdown documentation. 
                    You can provide highly customizable content at both the site and API level to offer additional context to developers.

              description: |
                Dev Portal APIs serve as a repository for your API specifications and documentation. 
                You can optionally version your APIs and publish them to one or more Portals. 
                This supports maintaining a central source of truth while offering developer-specific visibility.
