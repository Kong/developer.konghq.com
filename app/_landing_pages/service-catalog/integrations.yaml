                    **Integrations** are applications—either {{site.konnect_short_name}}-internal or external—that extend the functionality of the Service Catalog.

                    When enabled, an integration allows you to:
                    - **Discover new resources** from connected systems
                    - **Create new services** based on existing resources
                    - **View key events** associated with the integration
