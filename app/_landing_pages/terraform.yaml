                  Terraform is an infrastructure as code tool from HashiCorp. Primarily used for managing
                  infrastructure such as AWS, GCP or Azure deployments, Terraform can also be used to manage
                  your Kong configuration.

                  A common question we hear from you all is:

                  _"Why would I choose Terraform, and when would I choose [decK](/deck/)?"_

                  You should choose Terraform if one or more of the following is true:

                  * You have existing review and approval processes built around Terraform
                  * Your internal users are already familiar with HCL / Terraform

              Konnect regularly ships new features, and they start out as a _beta_ release. In order to provide early access to these features using Terraform, we provide the `konnect-beta` provider.

              The **BETA** provider currently supports Kong Mesh.
