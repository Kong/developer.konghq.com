                    It's a critical function that helps maintain
                    the performance and availability of web
                    services and APIs by controlling the request traffic.

                    - "**Cost Management:** Prevents a sharp increase in usage (therefore cost) from either a bug or deliberately heavy usage by a consumer."
                    - "**Quality of Service:** Certain user tiers may be given different rate limits to ensure a level of service. For example, premium users may have a higher rate limit than free users."

This is ideal for internal service-to-service communication where you need fine-grained control over traffic within the mesh."
