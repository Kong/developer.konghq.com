                    AI agents are rapidly becoming core components of modern software, driving the need for structured, reliable interfaces to access tools and data. The Model Context Protocol (MCP) addresses this by enabling agents to reason, plan, and act across services. However, scaling MCP in remote, distributed environments introduces new operational challenges.

                    Key concerns like authentication, context propagation, load balancing, and service discovery are familiar to those working in API infrastructure. As such, the API gateway—already proven in securing and scaling HTTP services—offers a strong foundation for bringing MCP to production.

                    Kong’s AI Gateway extends these capabilities to MCP. By applying established gateway patterns to emerging agent interfaces, Kong enables teams to manage remote MCP traffic with enterprise-grade security, performance, and developer experience
