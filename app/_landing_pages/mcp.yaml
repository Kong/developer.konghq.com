              AI agents are rapidly becoming core components of modern software, driving the need for structured, reliable interfaces to access tools and data. The Model Context Protocol (MCP) addresses this by enabling agents to reason, plan, and act across services. However, scaling MCP in remote, distributed environments introduces new operational challenges.

              {{site.ai_gateway}} enables teams to manage remote MCP traffic with enterprise-grade security, performance, authentication, context propagation, load balancing, and observability.

                  Turn any API into an MCP server using the AI MCP Proxy plugin. This approach does **not require an LLM** and provides full control over production workloads.

                  The AI MCP Proxy plugin:
                  - **Converts API schemas** into MCP-compatible tool definitions.
                  - **Aggregates multiple APIs** into a single MCP server endpoint.
                  - **Supports serverless deployments** for dynamic tool generation.
                  - **Integrates with AI assistants** like Claude Desktop and other MCP clients.

                  Use available {{site.base_gateway}} [plugins](/plugins/) to:
                  - **Secure access** with the [AI MCP OAuth2 plugin](/plugins/ai-mcp-oauth2/) or other authentication methods.
                  - **Monitor MCP traffic** using [AI metrics](/ai-gateway/monitor-ai-llm-metrics/#mcp-traffic-metrics) and [AI audit logs](/ai-gateway/ai-audit-log-reference/#ai-mcp-logs).
                  - **Enforce access controls** for [MCP tool usage](/mcp/use-access-controls-for-mcp-tools/).
                  - **Govern usage** with rate limiting and traffic control plugins.
