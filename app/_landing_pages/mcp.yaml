              AI agents are rapidly becoming core components of modern software, driving the need for structured, reliable interfaces to access tools and data. The Model Context Protocol (MCP) addresses this by enabling agents to reason, plan, and act across services. However, scaling MCP in remote, distributed environments introduces new operational challenges.

              Kong AI Gateway enables teams to manage remote MCP traffic with enterprise-grade security, performance, authentication, context propagation, load balancing, and observability.

                  You can expose any MCP server through AI Gateway or use Kong’s built-in MCP server for conversational control over your infrastructure. These options serve different purposes and are not mutually exclusive—you can use both depending on your needs.

                    For production environments, you can expose any remote MCP server to AI Gateway. This setup gives AI clients access to internal systems while enforcing strict control at the edge.

                    Use Kong AI Gateway plugins to:

                    - **Secure access** with plugins like OpenID Connect or Key Auth.
                    - **Govern usage** through rate limiting and traffic shaping.
                    - **Enforce quotas** based on tokens or user-level constraints.
                    - **Monitor behavior** using logging and distributed tracing with OpenTelemetry.

                    Kong provides a built-in MCP server that connects directly to your Konnect Control Planes. It offers read-only tools for analytics, configuration inspection, and Control Plane metadata—ideal for AI-driven workflows with Claude or other compatible assistants.

                    Use natural language to:

                    - Query API traffic across gateways with filters and time windows.
                    - List and inspect Services, Routes, Consumers, and plugins.
                    - Explore Control Plane hierarchies and group relationships.
                    - Build and test workflows without a production setup.

                   Kong AI Gateway lets you expose APIs as [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) servers, applying the same authentication, traffic control, and observability you use for any other service.

                   Instead of running custom MCP servers, you define your API schema and let the Gateway handle protocol translation, scaling, and policy enforcement.
                    - The **AI MCP** plugin performs the protocol translation and schema-based tool generation, so any API can participate in MCP workflows without custom servers.
                    - The **OAuth** plugin adds standardized client authentication and authorization, ensuring MCP endpoints follow the same access controls as the rest of your API ecosystem.
