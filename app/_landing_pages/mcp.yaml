              AI agents are rapidly becoming core components of modern software, driving the need for structured, reliable interfaces to access tools and data. The Model Context Protocol (MCP) addresses this by enabling agents to reason, plan, and act across services. However, scaling MCP in remote, distributed environments introduces new operational challenges.

              Kong AI Gateway enables teams to manage remote MCP traffic with enterprise-grade security, performance, authentication, context propagation, load balancing, and observability.

                  Kong AI Gateway lets you either connect any external MCP server or autogenerate MCP tools from your APIs. Both approaches can be combined to integrate APIs and workflows into MCP-driven AI assistants while maintaining security, observability, and traffic control.

                    For production environments, you can expose any remote MCP server to AI Gateway. This setup gives AI clients access to internal systems while enforcing strict control at the edge.

                    Use Kong AI Gateway plugins to:

                    - **Secure access** with plugins like OpenID Connect or Key Auth.
                    - **Govern usage** through rate limiting and traffic shaping.
                    - **Enforce quotas** based on tokens or user-level constraints.
                    - **Monitor behavior** using logging and distributed tracing with OpenTelemetry.

                    With Kong AI Gateway, you can also expose any API as an MCP server, auto-generate tools from its schema, and enforce OAuth-based access at the edge.

                    Use them to:
                    - Turn any API into an MCP server without writing custom code.
                    - Secure MCP endpoints with OAuth while keeping consistent access policies.
                    - Apply rate limiting, logging, and monitoring to MCP traffic.
                    - Integrate your APIs directly into MCP workflows and AI assistants.
