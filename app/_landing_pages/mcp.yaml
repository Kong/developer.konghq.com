                    AI agents are rapidly becoming core components of modern software, driving the need for structured, reliable interfaces to access tools and data. The Model Control Plane (MCP) addresses this by enabling agents to reason, plan, and act across services—but scaling MCP in remote, distributed environments introduces new operational challenges.

                    Key concerns like authentication, context propagation, load balancing, and service discovery are familiar to those working in API infrastructure. As such, the API gateway—already proven in securing and scaling HTTP services—offers a strong foundation for bringing MCP to production.

                    Kong’s AI Gateway, part of the Kong Konnect platform, extends these capabilities to MCP. By applying established gateway patterns to emerging agent interfaces, Kong enables teams to manage remote MCP traffic with enterprise-grade security, performance, and developer experience

                      Kong Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that connects AI assistants like Claude to Kong Konnect’s API Gateway. It enables natural language access to key gateway tools, including analytics, configuration inspection, and control plane management.

                      **Key features:**

                      * Query API analytics with customizable filters
                      * List and inspect services, routes, consumers, and plugins
                      * Manage control planes and control plane groups
                      * Integrate with Claude and other MCP-compatible AI assistants
