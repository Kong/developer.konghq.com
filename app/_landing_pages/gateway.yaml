                    {{ site.base_gateway }} is a lightweight, fast, and flexible cloud-native API gateway. An API gateway is a reverse proxy that lets you manage, configure, and route requests to your APIs.
                    
                    {{ site.base_gateway }} runs in front of any RESTful API and can be extended through modules and plugins. 
                    Itâ€™s designed to run on decentralized architectures, including hybrid-cloud and multi-cloud deployments.

                  You can use the [quickstart script](https://get.konghq.com/quickstart) to get an instance of {{ site.base_gateway }} running almost instantly:
                  
                  ```sh
                  curl -Ls https://get.konghq.com/quickstart | bash -s
                  ```

                  This script sets up two Docker containers: an Enterprise Gateway instance running in free mode, and a 
                  PostgreSQL database.
                  
                  Pass the `-- -h` option to the script to see all possible configuration options, including how to pass a license
                  to the script, switch to an open-source Gateway image, [enable RBAC](/gateway/entities/rbac/#enable-rbac), and more.

                  Visit the [Gateway install page](https://docs.konghq.com/gateway/latest/install/) for all other installation options.
