                    Kong Gateway is a lightweight, fast, and flexible cloud-native API gateway. An API gateway is a reverse proxy that lets you manage, configure, and route requests to your APIs.
                    
                    Kong Gateway runs in front of any RESTful API and can be extended through modules and plugins. 
                    Itâ€™s designed to run on decentralized architectures, including hybrid-cloud and multi-cloud deployments.
