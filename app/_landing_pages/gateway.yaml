                    {{ site.base_gateway }} is a lightweight, fast, and flexible cloud-native API gateway. An API gateway is a reverse proxy that lets you manage, configure, and route requests to your APIs.

                    {{ site.base_gateway }} runs in front of any RESTful API and can be extended through modules and plugins.
                    It's designed to run on decentralized architectures, including hybrid-cloud and multi-cloud deployments.

            You can use the [quickstart script](https://get.konghq.com/quickstart) to get an instance of {{ site.base_gateway }} running almost instantly:
        - type: tabs

            - title: Konnect
              content: |
                This command requires a [Konnect Access Token](https://cloud.konghq.com/global/account/tokens).

                ```sh
                curl -Ls https://get.konghq.com/quickstart | bash -s -- -k $KONNECT_TOKEN
                ```

                The script creates a Control Plane in Konnect and deploys a local Data Plane using Docker.

                All licensing is handled automatically by Konnect.
            - title: On-Prem
              content: |
                You must provide your Kong Gateway license in the `KONG_LICENSE_DATA` environment variable.

                ```sh
                curl -Ls https://get.konghq.com/quickstart | bash -s -- -e $KONG_LICENSE_DATA
                ```

                This script sets up two Docker containers: an Enterprise Gateway instance, and a
                PostgreSQL database.


        - type: text
          config: |
            Pass the `-- -h` option to the script to see all possible configuration options, including how to pass a license
            to the script, switch to an open-source Gateway image, [enable RBAC](/gateway/entities/rbac/#enable-rbac), and more.
