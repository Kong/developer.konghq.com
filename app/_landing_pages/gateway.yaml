                    Kong Gateway is a lightweight, fast, and flexible cloud-native API gateway. An API gateway is a reverse proxy that lets you manage, configure, and route requests to your APIs.
                    
                    Kong Gateway runs in front of any RESTful API and can be extended through modules and plugins. 
                    It’s designed to run on decentralized architectures, including hybrid-cloud and multi-cloud deployments.

                  You can use the [quickstart script](https://get.konghq.com/quickstart) to get an instance of Kong Gateway running almost instantly:
                  
                  ```sh
                  curl -Ls https://get.konghq.com/quickstart | bash -s
                  ```

                  This script sets up two Docker containers: an Enterprise Gateway instance running in free mode, and a 
                  PostgreSQL database.
                  
                  Pass the `-- -h` option to the script to see all possible configuration options, including how to pass a license
                  to the script, how to switch to an open-source Gateway image, enable RBAC, and more.

                  Visit the [Gateway install page](/gateway/install) for all other installation options.
