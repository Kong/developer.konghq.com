                    Kong Gateway allows you to limit how many HTTP requests can be made in a given period.

                    Rate limits can be applied to a [service](/gateway/entities/service/) or individual [routes](/gateway/entities/route/) to protect the upstream API, or to a [consumer](/gateway/entities/consumer/) to restrict how many times a user can call the API in the specified period.

                    In addition to the OSS Rate Limiting plugin, Kong offer an Enterprise rate limiting plugin with additional capabilities.

                    Rate limit based on `consumer`, `consumer-group`, `credential`, `ip`, `service`, `header` or `path`. If the route being accessed does not require authentication, rate limiting is applied to the Client IP.

                    The rate limit counter can be stored in memory, Redis, or in the Postgres database (traditional mode only).

                    Multiple rate limits can be configured, allowing you to specify complex rules such as 1000 requests per hour, but no more than 100 per minute.

                    Everything in OSS, plus:

                    * Enhanced window size configuration. You are no longer limited to pre-defined intervals
                    * Support for Redis Sentinel, Redis cluster and Redis SSL
                    * Additional rate limiting algorithms, including leaky bucket, fixed window and sliding window
                    * Precise control over high requests increment rate limiting counters (e.g. you may choose not to increment rate limiting if Kong Gateway blocks the request)
