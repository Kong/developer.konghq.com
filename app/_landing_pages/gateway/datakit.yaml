                    Datakit is a {{site.base_gateway}} plugin that lets you define workflows connecting multiple APIs, transforming their responses, and building dynamic data pipelines—without custom code.

                    It can:
                    - Set up internal auth within your ecosystem
                    - Call and combine third-party APIs
                    - Modify and transform request or response bodies
                    - Interact with {{site.base_gateway}} runtime data
                    - Return custom responses directly to clients
                    - Integrate with Vault and caching systems

                    Datakit is ideal for complex API integrations, data transformations, and building lightweight backends directly at the edge.

                    Datakit executes workflows as sequences of **nodes**—each node represents a specific operation such as making an HTTP call, transforming data, or retrieving a property from the gateway.

                    You can link nodes together to create execution flows where the output of one node feeds into another. 
                    This makes it easy to build sophisticated integrations that pull, merge, and enrich data from multiple sources.

                    Examples include:
                    - Merging responses from two APIs
                    - Dynamically updating request headers
                    - Injecting data from Vault secrets
                    - Returning a custom API response directly from the gateway

                    - [`call`](/plugins/datakit/#call-node): Send HTTP requests to external APIs  
                    - [`jq`](/plugins/datakit/#jq-node): Transform data and cast variables using `jq`  
                    - [`exit`](/plugins/datakit/#exit-node): Return directly to the client  
                    - [`property`](/plugins/datakit/#property-node): Read and write {{site.base_gateway}} properties  
                    - [`static`](/plugins/datakit/#static-node): Define static input values  
                    - [`json_to_xml`](/plugins/datakit/#json-to-xml-node): Convert JSON data into XML format
                    - [`xml_to_json`](/plugins/datakit/#xml-to-json-node): Convert XML data into JSON format
                    
                    Datakit also supports [implicit nodes](/plugins/datakit/#implicit-nodes) such as `request`, `response`, `vault`, and `service_request`, which represent gateway lifecycle events.

                    Datakit includes built-in debugging and execution tracing features to make it easier to troubleshoot node connections and data flow.

                    - Enable the `debug` option to expose node execution errors in responses.
                    - Add the `X-DataKit-Debug-Trace` header to get a full node execution trace, including timing, dependencies, and failures.
                    - Trace reports include node status (`NODE_ERROR`, `NODE_COMPLETE`, etc.) and dependency chains for in-depth analysis.
