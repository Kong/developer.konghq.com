                  A secret is any sensitive piece of information required for API gateway operations. 
              - type: text

                  Secrets can be information like the following:
              - type: unordered_list
                items:
                  - TLS certificates
                  - Credentials and API keys (to access databases, identity providers, and other services)
                  - Cryptographic keys (for digital signing and encryption)
              - type: text
                text: |
                  By storing these values as secrets, you ensure that they aren't visible in plain text in logs, the UI, `kong.conf`, or decK files. 
                  Once a secret is stored, you can use the secret reference instead of the sensitive information. For example, a secret stored in an environment variable called `MY_SECRET_POSTGRES_PASSWORD` would be referenced with `{vault://env/my-secret-postgres-password}`. 
                  
                  You can reference secrets in the following {{site.base_gateway}} configuration: 
              - type: unordered_list
                items:
                  - Any field in the [`kong.conf`](/gateway/configuration/)
                  - Referenceable fields in Kong plugins
                  - Configuration associated with APIs serviced by {{site.base_gateway}}

                  Secret management options vary depending on which {{site.base_gateway}} tier you have. {{site.base_gateway}} OSS users can only manage secrets by storing them in [environment variables](/gateway/entities/vault/#store-secrets-as-environment-variables). 
                  {{site.base_gateway}} Enterprise users can use environment variables as well as Vaults. The [Vaults entity](/gateway/entities/vault/) allows you to store and reference secrets from an external, third-party vault or {{site.konnect_short_name}} Config Store.

                  Secret rotation is a process that periodically updates secrets.
                  Secret rotation is important for the following reasons:
              - type: unordered_list
                items:
                  - Reducing the impact of compromised secrets
                  - Enhancing resilience against brute-force attacks
                  - Complying with security regulations
                  - Maintaining separation of duties
                  - Adapting to evolving threats
                  - Mitigating the effects of insider threats

        - type: structured_text
          config:
            header:
              text: "How can I rotate secrets in {{site.base_gateway}}?"
            blocks:
              - type: text
                text: |
                  If you have secrets rotation configured in your third-party vault settings, {{site.base_gateway}} can retrieve rotated secrets on a schedule.
                  {{site.base_gateway}} can be configured to check for rotated secrets in the following ways:
              - type: unordered_list
                items:
                  - Check periodically using TTLs (for example, check for new TLS certificates once per day). This can be configured in the [Vault entity](/gateway/entities/vault/) configuration.
                  - Check on failure (for example, on database authentication failure, check if the secrets were updated, and try again). You must write code in {{site.base_gateway}} to configure this, so support is limited to PostgreSQL credentials for now.
