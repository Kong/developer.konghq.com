                    {{site.base_gateway}} can expose metrics using either of the following:
                    * [**Admin API**](https://developer.konghq.com/api/gateway/admin-ee/): Available at the `/metrics` endpoint and is enabled by default for {{site.base_gateway}} on-prem. 
                    * [**Status API**](https://developer.konghq.com/api/gateway/status/v1/#/paths/metrics/get): Available at the `/metrics` endpoint and is disabled by default. 
                      You must enable [`status_listen`](/gateway/configuration/#status-listen) to use the Status API. 
                      If you're using {{site.konnect_short_name}}, you must use the Status API.
                    
                    {{site.base_gateway}} will report system wide performance metrics by default. 
                    You can use Kong monitoring plugins to scrape the metrics.
                    When a monitoring plugin has been installed and traffic is being proxied, it will record additional metrics across Gateway Service, Route, and Upstream dimensions.

                    API gateways isolate your applications from the outside world and provide critical path
                    protection for your upstream services. Understanding the state of your API gateway
                    system is critical to providing reliable API-based systems.

                    There are many monitoring and alerting systems available, and {{site.base_gateway}} integrates with 
                    multiple solutions:

                    Health checking is an activity performed by infrastructure components (that is, load balancers) to monitor the health of a {{site.base_gateway}} node.
                    This helps determine if a {{site.base_gateway}} node is operational and ready to process incoming requests. 
                    You can learn more about health checks (also known as "probes") in the [Health check probes](/gateway/traffic-control/health-check-probes/) guide.

                    While infrastructure environments can vary widely, we encourage you to follow these general recommendations:

                    * Enable the [`status_listen`](/gateway/configuration/#status-listen) configuration parameter.
                    * Always health check {{site.base_gateway}} and track the health in monitoring dashboards such as Datadog, Grafana, AppDynamics, and so on.
                    * Configure the load balancer or other components immediately fronting {{site.base_gateway}} to use the [readiness probe](/gateway/traffic-control/health-check-probes/).
                    * In the case of Kubernetes, configure both [liveness and readiness probes](/gateway/traffic-control/health-check-probes/) for {{site.base_gateway}}, ensuring a load balancer uses the correct [Kubernetes endpoints](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#endpoints) to forward traffic to {{site.base_gateway}} pods. 
                      Don't expect the {{site.base_gateway}} readiness endpoint to respond with a `200 OK` immediately after startup, as it always takes a short time for {{site.base_gateway}} to load the first configuration and build all the necessary data structures before it can successfully proxy traffic.
                    * Set up alerting based on responses to the health checks to be proactive in case of an incident.
                    * Don't use the [`kong health`](/gateway/cli/reference/#kong-health) CLI command to validate the overall health of the {{site.base_gateway}}, as this command only ensures that the {{site.base_gateway}} process is running and doesn't ensure the ability or validity of the configuration.
                    * Ensure that all nodes in a cluster are monitored. For example, checking only one Data Plane node in a cluster can't offer reliable insight into the health of other Data Plane nodes in the same cluster.
