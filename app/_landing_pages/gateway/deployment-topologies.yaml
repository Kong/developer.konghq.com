                    Kong provides different modes for you to deploy {{site.konnect_short_name}} and {{site.base_gateway}} in. 
                    Each mode has benefits and limitations, so it is important to consider them carefully when deciding which mode to use to in production installations.

                    Looking for ways to host your Data Plane? See the [Supported Data Plane hosting options](/gateway/topology-hosting-options/).

                    In hybrid mode, {{site.base_gateway}} nodes in a cluster are split into two roles: Control Plane
                    (CP), where configuration is managed, and data
                    plane (DP), which serves traffic for the proxy.

                    Hybrid mode deployments have the following benefits:

                    * Users can deploy groups of Data Planes in different data centers, geographies, or zones without needing a local clustered database for each DP group.
                    * The availability of the database does not affect the availability of the Data Planes. If a Control Plane is offline, Data Planes will run using their last known configuration.
                    * Drastically reduces the amount of traffic to and from the database, since only CP nodes need a direct connection to the database.
                    * If one of the DP nodes is compromised, an attacker wonâ€™t be able to affect other nodes in the {{site.base_gateway}} cluster.

                    In traditional mode, {{site.base_gateway}} requires a database to store configured entities such as Routes, Services, and plugins.
                    In a traditional deployment, all {{site.base_gateway}} nodes connect to the database. Each node manages its own configuration. 

                    It is the only deployment topology that supports plugins that require a database, like rate-limiting with the cluster strategy, or OAuth2. 
                    However, there are some downsides too.
                    When running in traditional mode, every {{ site.base_gateway }} node runs as both a Control Plane (CP) and Data Plane (DP). This means that if **any** of your nodes are compromised, the entire running gateway configuration is compromised. 

                    In addition, if you're running {{site.ee_product_name}} with [Kong Manager](/gateway/kong-manager/), request throughput may be reduced on nodes running Kong Manager due to expensive calculations being run to render analytics data and graphs.

                    You can enable DB-less mode to reduce complexity of and create more flexible deployment patterns. In this mode, configured entities such as Routes, Services and plugins are stored in-memory on the node.
                    When running in DB-less mode, configuration is provided to {{ site.base_gateway }} using a second file. This file contains your configuration in YAML or JSON format using {{site.base_gateway}}'s declarative configuration syntax.

                    The combination of DB-less mode and declarative configuration has a number
                    of benefits:

                    * Reduced number of dependencies: no need to manage a database installation
                      if the entire setup for your use-case fits in memory.
                    * Your configuration is always in a known state. There is no intermediate 
                      state between creating a Service and a Route using the Admin API.
                    * It is a good fit for automation in CI/CD scenarios. Configuration for
                      entities can be kept in a single source of truth managed via a Git
                      repository.

                    Here are a few limitations of this mode:

                    * The [Admin API](/api/gateway/admin-ee/) is read only.
                    * Any plugin that stores information in the database, like rate limiting (cluster mode), don't fully function.
