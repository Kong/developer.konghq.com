                    OpenID Connect (OIDC) is a standard built on top of OAuth and JWT (JSON Web Token). 
                    It provides authentication and authorization, letting you connect {{site.base_gateway}} to an identity provider (IdP),
                    where the system you interact with can determine who you are and give you access to the correct resources.

                    {{site.base_gateway}} provides an [OpenID Connect plugin](/plugins/openid-connect/) with support for a large variety of auth flows and grants.
                    With this plugin, you can leverage an IdP for both authentication and authorization without having to manage consumers or groups in {{site.base_gateway}}.
                    This allows you to provide secure developer access without additional operational overhead and risk. 

                    The OIDC plugin also includes session management and support for the Financial-Grade API (FAPI) standard.

              Set it up with Keycloak as a sample identity provider (IdP) to test out the OIDC plugin.
