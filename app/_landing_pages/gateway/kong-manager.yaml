                    Kong Manager is the graphical user interface (GUI) for {{site.base_gateway}}.
                    It uses the [Admin API](/api/gateway/admin-ee/) under the hood to administer and control {{site.base_gateway}}. 
                    If you're running {{site.base_gateway}} on-prem with a database (either in traditional or hybrid mode), you can enable Kong Manager.

                    You can do the following with Kong Manager:
                - type: unordered_list
                  items:
                    - Manage all Workspaces in one place
                    - Create and manage Routes and Gateway Services
                    - Activate or deactivate plugins
                    - Manage Certificates
                    - "Manage RBAC for {{site.base_gateway}}: users, admins, roles, permissions, and teams"
                    - Centrally store and easily access Key Sets and Keys
                    - Manage Vaults
                    - Customize the header and footer for your own organization

                  If you're running {{site.base_gateway}} on-prem with a database (either in traditional
                  or hybrid mode), you can [enable Kong Manager](/gateway/kong-manager-configuration/#enable-kong-manager/). If you run the [{{site.base_gateway}} quickstart script](https://get.konghq.com/quickstart), Kong Manager is automatically enabled.

                  Access Kong Manager at its default URL: [http://localhost:8002](http://localhost:8002)

                  You can configure Kong Manager settings (like URL and path) and customization (like header and footer colors) using [parameters in `kong.conf`](/gateway/configuration/#kong-manager-section). If you want to enable Kong Manager for multiple domains, see [multiple domains](/gateway/kong-manager-configuration/#multiple-domains).

              Workspaces enable an organization to segment objects and admins into namespaces. 
              The segmentation allows teams of admins sharing the same {{site.base_gateway}} cluster to adopt roles for interacting with specific objects.
