                    Kong Manager is the graphical user interface (GUI) for {{site.base_gateway}}.
                    It uses the [Admin API](/api/gateway/admin-ee/) under the hood to administer and control {{site.base_gateway}}. 
                    If you're running {{site.base_gateway}} on-prem with a database (either in traditional or hybrid mode), you can enable Kong Manager.

                    You can do the following with Kong Manager:
                - type: unordered_list
                  items:
                    - Manage all Workspaces in one place
                    - Create and manage Routes and Gateway Services
                    - Activate or deactivate plugins
                    - Manage Certificates
                    - Manage users and roles for {{site.base_gateway}}
                    - Centrally store and easily access Key Sets and Keys

                  If you're running {{site.base_gateway}} on-prem with a database (either in traditional
                  or hybrid mode), you can [enable Kong Manager](/gateway/enable-kong-manager/). If you run the [{{site.base_gateway}} quickstart script](https://get.konghq.com/quickstart), Kong Manager is automatically enabled.

                  If you want to enable Kong Manager for multiple domains in {{site.base_gateway}} 3.9.x or later, see [Multiple domains](/gateway/enable-kong-manager/#multiple-domains).

              The segmentation allows teams of admins sharing the same {{site.base_gateway}} cluster to adopt roles for interacting with specific objects.
