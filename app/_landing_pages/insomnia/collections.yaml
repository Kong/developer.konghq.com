                    Collections are a way to group requests in Insomnia. You can use them to:
                - type: unordered_list
                  items: 
                    - "[Create and send requests](#send-requests)"
                    - "[Run multiple requests](#get-started-with-requests) with the Collection Runner"
                    - "[Write scripts](#write-scripts) to modify requests or check responses"
      - blocks:
          - type: image
            config:
              url: /assets/images/insomnia/collection.png
              alt_text: Image of a collection
  
  - header:
      type: h2
      text: "Send requests"
    columns:
      - blocks:
          - type: structured_text
            config:
              blocks:
                - type: text
                  text: | 
                    With Insomnia, you can send requests via HTTP, gRPC, GraphQL, and WebSockets. You can send a single request or run a series of requests in a specific order.

                    The pre-request and after-response scripts allows you to interact with the request and its response. You can use these to:
                - type: unordered_list
                  items:
                  - Set or unset variables
                  - Update the contents of the request
                  - Dynamically update request bodies
                  - Test the response
      - blocks:
        - type: image
          config:
            url: /assets/images/insomnia/after-response-script.png
            alt_text: Image of an after-response script

            - q: What's the difference between a collection and a design document?
              a: Documents are a data object that can contain an API spec, a collection of API requests, and tests. Collections are simply a series of API requests that you intend to interact with Insomnia.
            - q: Can I import requests from another tool?
              a: |
                Yes, you can create requests in collections by importing:
                - Postman collections
                - Swagger/OpenAPI specifications
                - cURL commands
                - Insomnia files
                - HAR files
                - WSDL files
            - q: Can I run collections in CI/CD environments?
              a: Yes, you can use the [`inso run collection`](/inso-cli/reference/run_collection/) command in Inso CLI to run a collection automatically.
