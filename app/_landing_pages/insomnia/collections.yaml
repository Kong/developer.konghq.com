                    Collections are a way to group requests in Insomnia. You can use them to:
                - type: unordered_list
                  items: 
                    - "[Create and send requests](#send-requests)"
                    - "[Run multiple requests](#get-started-with-requests) with the Collection Runner"
                    - "[Write scripts](#write-scripts) to modify requests or check responses"
      - blocks:
          - type: image
            config:
              url: /assets/images/insomnia/collection.png
              alt_text: Image of a collection
  
  - header:
      type: h2
      text: "Send requests"
    columns:
      - blocks:
          - type: structured_text
            config:
              blocks:
                - type: text
                  text: | 
                    With Insomnia, you can send requests via HTTP, gRPC, GraphQL, and WebSockets. You can send a single request or run a series of requests in a specific order.

                    The pre-request and after-response scripts allows you to interact with the request and its response. You can use these to:
                - type: unordered_list
                  items:
                  - Set or unset variables
                  - Update the contents of the request
                  - Dynamically update request bodies
                  - Test the response

          config:
            - q: What's the difference between a collection and a design document?
              a: Documents are a data object that can contain an API spec, a collection of API requests, and tests. Collections are simply a series of API requests that you intend to interact with Insomnia.
            - q: Can I import requests from another tool?
              a: |
                Yes, you can create requests in collections by importing:
                - Postman collections
                - Swagger/OpenAPI specifications
                - cURL commands
                - Insomnia files
                - HAR files
                - WSDL files
            - q: Can I run collections in CI/CD environments?
              a: Yes, you can use the [`inso run collection`](/inso-cli/reference/run_collection/) command in Inso CLI to run a collection automatically.
            - q: Can I set authentication headers at the collection level so I don't repeat them on every request?
              a: |
                No. As a workaround, group the relevant requests in a **folder** and then set authentication at the folder level for that group to avoid duplicating headers on each request.
            - q: How do I export collection run results as JSON?
              a: |
                Use the [Inso CLI](/inso-cli/) to export collection run results. Metadata export doesn't include bodies or headers:

                ```sh
                inso run collection "My Collection" --env "Base Environment" --output results.json
                ```

                To export full request and response data, set the export mode with `--includeFullData` and accept the security warning:

                ```sh
                inso run collection "My Collection" \
                --env "Base Environment" \
                --includeFullData=redact \
                --acceptRisk \
                --output results.json
                ```

                For details on supported modes, redaction, and truncation rules, go to the [export collection run results reference](/insomnia/export-collection-run-results/).
