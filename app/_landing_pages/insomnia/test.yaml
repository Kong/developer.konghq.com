                    {:.warning}
                    > **Deprecation advisory**: In 2026, we will deprecate **unit tests**. To create new tests or maintain existing tests, we recommend that users migrate to pre-request and after-response [scripts.](/insomnia/scripts/)

                    Insomnia has several testing features that can help you ensure the quality of your APIs:

                  items:
                    - Pre-request and after-response scripting to add logic to your requests
                    - Automate your tests with Inso CLI
                    - Test complex workflows by chaining the responses from requests together
                    - Execute unlimited test runs simultaneously 
                    - Import your tests from Postman

                    Insomnia automatically stores cookies from every response and sends them with future requests as needed, just like a web browser.
                    You can manage cookies within each workspace by clicking **Cookies**, which opens the cookie manager. From there, you can view, modify, or delete cookies.

                    Sending and storing cookies is enabled by default, but can be customized per request in the request settings dialog.

                    Use [template tags](/insomnia/template-tags/) to reference cookie values in headers, bodies, or query parameters of other requests.

            description: Use the Insomnia CLI to automate the execution of your API tests using your existing Git workflows. For example, you can make it so that every pull request needs to run the API tests successfully before they can be merged.
