                    > As of Insomnia v12, AI features are free to use, though this may change in future releases.

                    Insomnia 12 introduces a suite of **AI-driven capabilities** that make API development faster, smarter, and more collaborative. These include:
                    - [**MCP Servers and Clients**](/insomnia/mcp-servers/#mcp-servers-and-clients), which connect to external AI-ready tools and resources.  
                    - [**AI-assisted mock server generation**](/insomnia/self-hosted-mocks/#create-an-auto-generated-mock-server), which transforms prompts or API definitions into mock APIs.  
                    - [**AI commit message suggestions**](/insomnia/ai-in-insomnia/#ai-driven-git-commits), which help maintain clear and atomic commit histories.

                    Activate these features by enabling a **Large Language Model (LLM)** in **Preferences > AI Settings**.  
                    Choose from one of the following providers:
                    - **Local**
                    - **Claude**
                    - **OpenAI**
                    - **Gemini**

                    {:.info}
                    > Local models keep processing fully on your machine for privacy and control, but may run slower and produce less-refined responses than hosted models.

                    Once an LLM is activated, Insomnia unlocks multiple AI features that are designed to automate repetitive workflows, generate content dynamically, and enhance collaboration.

                    Activate features by choosing and uploading an LLM in **Preferences > AI Settings**:

                    1. Click **Preferences**.  
                    1. Select the **AI Settings** tab.  
                    1. In the provider list, choose a LLM type: 
                    1. Enter your credentials or select a local model.
                    1. Click **Activate**.

                    After activation you can toggle **Auto-generate Mock Servers** and **Suggest commit comments** from the **AI Features** panel

                    **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** Servers expose domain-specific operations through a **JSON-RPC interface**. For example:
                      - `tools/CALL`
                      - `resources/READ`
                      - `prompts/GET`

                    When you connect Insomnia to an MCP Server, Insomnia creates an **MCP Client** that acts like a synchronized request group. The client stays updated with tools, prompts, and resources published by the server. When offline, you will view cached data until you resync.

                     **Use MCP Clients to:**
                    - Discover and execute callable tools  
                    - Retrieve structured resources  
                    - Explore and test AI-driven prompts  
                    - Resync data from the server as it changes 

                    **Transports available:** HTTP and STDIO.

              - q: Can I disable AI features for myself?
                a: |
                  Yes. Go to **Preferences → AI Settings** and deactivate the toggles for **Auto-generate Mock Servers** and **Suggest commit comments**.  
                  To stop using an LLM entirely, click **Deactivate** under the provider configuration.
              - q: Why don’t I see AI features in the app?
                a: |
                  You must first configure and activate an LLM under **Preferences → AI Settings**.  
                  If AI is deactivated at the instance level, the feature toggles will remain unavailable in the UI.
              - q: How do I manage AI across my organization?
                a: |
                  Administrators can enable or disable AI features at the instance level from **Insomnia Admin → AI Settings**.  
                  When deactivated, the desktop app shows an explanatory message.  
                  When activated, each user must still activate a model before toggles become available.
              - q: Which transports are supported for MCP Clients?
                a: |
                  Both **HTTP** and **STDIO** transports are supported for connecting to MCP Servers.
              - q: Can MCP Clients use Git Sync or Import/Export?
                a: |
                  Not yet. MCP Clients are stored locally and currently do not support Git Sync or import/export.
