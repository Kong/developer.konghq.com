                    Git Sync is designed for teams that want Git-native workflows, full data ownership, and direct control over where their data lives.

                    With Git Sync:
                    - Your data lives in your Git repository.
                    - Insomnia does not host or manage your project data.
                    - Collaboration follows standard Git workflows.
                    - You can use Git features such as version control, peer review, and auditable change history.
                    - You retain local ownership of your data.

                    Git Sync uses a third-party Git repository to store Insomnia project data. Supported native Git providers include GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket. Additionally, Git Sync also works with other providers if you manually configure credentials.

                    {:.info}
                    > Git Sync is not Insomnia Cloud storage. Git Sync projects are not automatically shared across Insomnia organizations, and they are not managed or hosted by Insomnia. If you require automatic sharing and cloud-hosted storage, use [Insomnia Cloud Sync](/insomnia/storage#cloud-sync/) instead.

                    **Direct-to-Git architecture**: 
                      - Insomnia syncs directly between your device and your Git provider. This means that your project data never touches Insomnia servers.
                      - All storage, access control, retention, and auditability are handled by your Git provider and your existing Git governance practices.

              Expect occasional system changes in Git Sync projects. System changes exist because Git Sync communicates directly with Git, which means that Insomnia must store some Insomnia-specific metadata in the repository.
                - These updates appear as system changes
                - They support internal features such as tracking and access-related metadata

              {:.warning}
              > System changes are intentional and required for Git Sync to work correctly. You may see system changes even when you did not edit a request. Insomnia is improving how system changes are labelled and displayed, starting in Insomnia 12.4.

              Git Sync uses Git as the collaboration layer instead of Insomnia Cloud sharing. Git Sync projects are: 
                - Exist locally on the user’s device.
                - Are not automatically shared through Insomnia organizations.

               Collaboration happens through standard Git workflows, including branches, commits, and merges. Each collaborator: 
                - Clones the repository.
                - Configures Git Sync in Insomnia.
                - Works in their own local Insomnia project connected to that repository.

              **Supported Git actions**

              From the Git Sync interface, you can:
              - Create and check out branches.
              - Commit changes.
              - Commit and push changes.
              - Pull changes from the repository.
              - Merge branches.
              - Resolve conflicts.

              **Branch behaviour and protections**

              Git Sync follows standard Git branch behaviour:
              - Branches are object-specific.
              - Branches are not shared across different objects.
              - Repository branch protections are respected.
              - Protected branches cannot be pushed to from Insomnia.

          - type: text
            config: |
              **Commit history and revert behaviour**

              Git Sync does not currently provide a way to revert commits from the UI. If you need to revert a change, use your Git provider’s tools. Support for reverting commits in the Git Sync UI is planned for a future release.

              Not every sync requires conflict resolution. Git Sync resolves conflicts only when manual input is required. The merge UI appears when:
                - Local changes exist.
                - Remote changes exist.
                - Both changes affect the same content.
                - You perform a pull or push action.

              Git Sync uses 3-way merge to resolve conflicts. When a conflict occurs, the following flow applies:
              1. A pull or push action triggers a conflict.
              2. The merge UI opens.
              3. You select which changes to keep.
              4. You commit the merged result.
              5. You push the merge to the repository.

              Insomnia doesn't enforce secret prevention in Git repositories. To reduce the risk of committing sensitive data:
                - Use Private Environments for secrets.
                - Integrate with an external vault.
                - Apply external Git controls like hooks or scanners.

              You can use the Inso CLI with Git Sync projects to automate workflows and integrate with local tooling. The Inso CLI works with data that is available on your local machine.

              Git Sync stores collections, design documents, and other resources as YAML files in the repository. You can organize these files anywhere within the repository structure.

              When using Inso, specify the path to the file you want to operate on. For example:

              ```sh
              inso run collection <collection-name>.yaml
              ```

              Key points to be aware of:
              - Inso CLI is available for Git Sync projects.
              - Inso CLI works only with locally available data.

          config:
            - q: Should I use Git Sync or Cloud Sync?
              a: Both allow you to use version control and collaborate with your team. You should use Git Sync if you're already using a Git repository and your team requires detailed version tracking and rollback capabilities.
            - q: I'm using Git Sync, does Insomnia uphold the branch protections we have in our repository?
              a: Yes, if you have branch protections for a branch, say `main`, you won't be able to push to that branch in Insomnia.
            - q: With Git Sync, if I create a branch in my Git repository, will it pull that branch into Insomnia? And vice versa?
              a: Yes, you'll have to pull it into Insomnia. You can push branches you make in Insomnia to your repository. 
            - q: What are the user and Git Sync limits for the Essentials plan?  
              a: |
                On the **Essentials** plan, you can choose one of two configurations:
                - Activate **Git Sync** with a limit of up to **3 users** per organization.
                - Deactivate **Git Sync** and allow **unlimited users**.

                You can switch between configurations at any time.  
                When you reach the limit, Insomnia automatically flags it in the application. For example, if you try to add a fourth user while Git Sync is activated, or activate Git Sync when more than three users are already active.  
                In either case, you can reduce users or disable Git Sync to continue
            - q: What happens if I change a Git Sync project into a Cloud Sync project?
              a: |
                When you change a Git Sync storage type project to a Cloud Sync storage type, the project is no longer connected to your Git repository. Any new changes made after the conversion are stored in Insomnia Cloud and are not reflected in the original repository. Your existing files in the Git repository are not deleted or modified by this change. 
                
                To update the storage type, go to the project’s **Project Settings**, select **Change** from the **Type** dropdown, choose **Cloud Sync**, and then click **Update**. 
                
                {:.decorative}
                > **Tip:** Before converting, make sure that you pull the latest updates from the repository, as any changes that aren't pulled beforehand aren't included in the Cloud Sync project. If needed, switch the project back to a local or Git-based workflow later.    
            - q: Can I change a Git Sync project into a Local Vault project?
              a: |
                Yes. You can convert a Git Sync storage type project to Local Vault storage type at any time. Go to the project’s **Project Settings**, select **Change** from the **Type** dropdown, choose **Local Vault**, and then click **Update**. 
                
                After conversion, the project is stored entirely on your local device and is no longer synchronized with Git. Changes made to the project will not be reflected in your local or remote repository. This action does not delete or modify the remote repository.

                > **Tip:** Before converting, make sure that you pull the latest project updates, as any changes that aren't pulled beforehand aren't included in the Local Vault project.
            - q: What happens if my Git repository contains legacy Insomnia content when I create a Git Sync project?
              a: If the Git repository you connect contains legacy Insomnia content, Insomnia automatically converts that content to the current project format during project creation. This ensures that the content is compatible with modern Insomnia workflows. If the repository already contains Insomnia content, whether legacy or current, Insomnia prompts you to import that content into the new Git Sync project before continuing.
            - q: Can I revert commits from the Git Sync UI in Insomnia?
              a: |
                No. Insomnia does not provide a user interface for reverting commits in Git Sync projects.

                If you need to revert a commit, use your Git provider or local Git tooling to perform the revert operation.
