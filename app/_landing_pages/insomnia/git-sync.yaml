                  Git Sync connects Insomnia directly to your Git repository. Your project data stays in your repository. Insomnia does not host or manage it.

                  Changes move between your local environment and your Git provider through standard Git workflows.

                  Git Sync is designed for teams that:
                  - Require full data ownership.
                  - Enforce repository-level governance.
                  - Already collaborate using Git.
                  - Need their API workflow to align with existing Git processes.

                  Supported providers include GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket. Other providers work with manual credential configuration.

            **How it works**

            - Insomnia stores project resources as YAML files in your repository.
            - Each collaborator clones the repository locally.
            - Commits, branches, merges, and pulls follow standard Git workflows.
            - Repository protections and access controls are enforced by your Git provider.

            Insomnia acts as a Git client inside the application.

              **Version control inside Insomnia**

              Git Sync brings standard Git workflows into the Insomnia interface.

              From the version control panel, you can:
              - Create and switch branches.
              - Stage and commit changes.
              - Push and pull updates.
              - Merge branches.
              - Resolve conflicts.

              All operations follow your repository’s existing rules and protections.

              **Repository rules and boundaries**

              Branch protections configured in your Git provider are enforced. If a branch is protected, it cannot be pushed to from Insomnia.

              Commit reverts are performed using your Git provider or local Git tooling.

              **Authentication**

              Git credentials can be configured through:
              - Git Sync settings.
              - Insomnia Preferences.
              - Local Git configuration.

              Insomnia does not enforce secret prevention in your repository. Use Private Environments, external vaults, or repository scanners to manage sensitive data.

              **Automation and local tooling**

              Git Sync works with the Inso CLI and other local tooling.

              Project resources are stored as YAML files in your repository.

              Example:

              ```sh
              inso run collection <collection-name>.yaml
              ```

              The CLI operates on locally available data.

              Git Sync stores project data directly in your repository. To support certain application features, Insomnia also writes additional metadata alongside that data.

              As a result, you may occasionally see metadata updates in your repository even when no request content has changed. These updates:

              - Maintain project structure and consistency.
              - Support feature compatibility across versions.
              - Ensure reliable collaboration between contributors.

              These metadata updates are part of how Git Sync operates.

    columns:
      - blocks:
          - type: faqs
            config:
              - q: Should I use Git Sync or Cloud Sync?
                a: Use Git Sync if you require repository-level ownership and governance. Use Cloud Sync if you prefer managed sharing through Insomnia organizations.
              - q: Does Git Sync respect branch protections?
                a: Yes. Repository branch protections are enforced by your Git provider and cannot be bypassed from Insomnia.
              - q: What happens if I convert a Git Sync project?
                a: The project disconnects from the repository. Existing repository data remains unchanged.
              - q: Can I revert commits from the Git Sync UI?
                a: No. Reverts must be performed using your Git provider or local Git tooling.
              - q: Can I convert a Git Sync project to another storage type?
                a: |
                  Yes. Git Sync projects can be converted to Cloud Sync or Local Vault.

                  When you convert a project:
                  - It disconnects from the Git repository.
                  - The existing repository is not deleted or modified.
                  - Future changes are stored in the selected storage type.

                  Before converting, pull the latest repository changes to ensure your local state is current.
              - q: Can administrators restrict available storage types?
                a: |
                  Yes. Enterprise administrators can control which storage types are available to users through Enterprise Controls > Storage.
