                    A mock server is a tool used to simulate API endpoints. These can be particularly useful while [designing an API](/insomnia/design/). They can be self-hosted or hosted on the cloud.

                    The Insomnia Cloud mock servers allow you to create a mock endpoint in a few steps. You simply need to provide an endpoint and a sample response. You get a number or free mock requests based on your plan. For more details, see the [pricing page](https://insomnia.rest/pricing).

                  Enterprise users can deploy self-hosted mock servers using [Insomnia Mockbin](https://github.com/kong/insomnia-mockbin). This allows you to have more control over usage for your mocks.

                    Auto-generate a mock server from a natural language prompt and one of the following input types: URL, OpenAPI, or JSON. This feature is optional and can be deactivated.

                    * Always be sure you trust the author of a mock server before calling it, visiting it, or adding it to your code. 
                    * Like any URL, mock servers can contain malicious content or redirects.
                    * To enable easy use from anywhere, especially for front-end feature development, Insomnia's mock servers have a very permissive CORS configuration (`Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`, `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true`). 
                    A malicious API could be used to exfiltrate data.

                    Dynamic mocking expands Insomniaâ€™s mock servers with templates that generate context-aware and realistic responses.  
                    Each response is rendered server-side by the mock server using  templates with a safe, restricted tag set.  
                    Insomnia also provides **Faker template tags** for generating random names, dates, and other test data at runtime.

                    Dynamic mocking is supported in **self-hosted** mock servers, and powered by the Insomnia **Mockbin** service.

            - q: Are mock servers available for all users?
              a: Yes, all plans have access to mocks, with some limitations based on the plan. Enterprise users have unlimited requests on cloud-hosted mock servers and have the option to deploy self-hosted mocks. See the API mocking section of the [pricing page](https://insomnia.rest/pricing) for more information.
            - q: Can I automatically generate mock endpoints?
              a: |
                Yes, you can generate a mock endpoint from a request response. 
                After sending a request, go to the **Mock** tab in the right panel and select or create a new mock server and route.
                The generated endpoint will contain the response body, headers, and status.
