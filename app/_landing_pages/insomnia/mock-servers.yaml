                    A mock server is a tool used to simulate API endpoints. These can be particularly useful while [designing an API](/insomnia/design/). Insomnia offers cloud-hosted mock servers, but you can also deploy self-hosted mocks.

                    The Insomnia Cloud mock servers allow you to create a mock endpoint in a few steps. You simply need to provide an endpoint and a sample response. You get a number or free mock requests based on your plan. For more details, see the [pricing page](https://insomnia.rest/pricing).

                  Enterprise users can deploy self-hosted mock servers using [Insomnia Mockbin](https://github.com/kong/insomnia-mockbin). This allows you to have more control over usage for your mocks.

            - q: Are mock servers available for all users?
              a: Yes, all plans have access to mocks, with some limitations based on the plan. Enterprise users have unlimited requests on cloud-hosted mock servers and have the option to deploy self-hosted mocks. See the API mocking section of the [pricing page](https://insomnia.rest/pricing) for more information.
            - q: Can I automatically generate mock endpoints?
              a: Yes, you can generate a mock endpoint from a request response. The generated endpoint will contain the response body, headers, and status.
