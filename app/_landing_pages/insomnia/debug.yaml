                    Insomnia will alert you if your request is missing any environment variables before you send the request.
                    In addition, you can use the console to further debug any issues with sending requests.

                    Insomnia creates a console log for every request you send, so you can view the detail of what happened when you sent a request.

                    The Insomnia console logs the following information:
                - type: text
                  text: |
                    - The primary request that was sent as well as the headers sent
                    - The raw response sent by the server before it's processed by Insomnia
                    - Network information such as IP addresses, ciphers, and protocols used
                    - The certificates presented by the server that were used for the request
