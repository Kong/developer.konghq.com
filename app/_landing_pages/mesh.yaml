                    With Kong Mesh, you can run and manage a distributed service mesh across Kubernetes and VMs in any environment.

                    **Benefits of Kong Mesh:**
                    - Built-in mTLS, service discovery, and traffic management.
                    - Support for [multi-zone](/mesh/mesh-multizone-service-deployment/) and multi-tenant topologies.
                    - Runs on both Kubernetes and Universal (VM / Bare metal) environments.
                    - [Enterprise features](/mesh/enterprise/) like access control and advanced observability.

                    You can manage your mesh environments using the [Konnect Mesh GUI](https://cloud.konghq.com/us/mesh-manager/).
