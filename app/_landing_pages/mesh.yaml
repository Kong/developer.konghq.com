                    Kong Mesh is a modern service mesh built on top of Kuma and Envoy, designed for simplicity, scalability, and security.

                    With Kong Mesh, you can run and manage a distributed service mesh across Kubernetes and VMs in any environment.

                    **Benefits of Kong Mesh:**
                    - Built-in mTLS, service discovery, and traffic management.
                    - Support for [multi-zone](/mesh/mesh-multizone-service-deployment/) and multi-mesh topologies.
                    - Runs on both Kubernetes and Universal (VM) environments.
                    - [Enterprise features](/mesh/enterprise/) like access control and advanced observability.

                    You can manage your mesh deployments using the [Kong Mesh GUI](https://cloud.konghq.com/mesh/).

                  You can use the following to get an instance of {{site.mesh_product_name}} in Universal mode running:
                  
                  1. Go to the [{{site.mesh_product_name}} packages](https://cloudsmith.io/~kong/repos/{{site.mesh_product_name_path}}-binaries-release/packages/?q=version%3A{{ page.version_data.version }}) page to download and extract the installation archive for your OS, or download and extract the latest release automatically (Linux or macOS):
                     ```shell
                     curl -L {{site.links.web}}/mesh/installer.sh | VERSION={{site.data.mesh_latest.version}} sh -
                     ```
                  2. To finish installation, add {{site.mesh_product_name}} binaries to path:
                     ```shell
                     export PATH=$(pwd)/{{site.mesh_product_name_path}}-{{site.data.mesh_latest.version}}/bin:$PATH
                     ```
                     This directory contains binaries for `kuma-dp`, `kuma-cp`, `kumactl`, `envoy` and `coredns`
