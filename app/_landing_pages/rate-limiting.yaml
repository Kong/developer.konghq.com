                  text: Rate limiting controls the number of API requests a client can make within a specified time frame. 
                    It's a critical function that helps maintain
                    the performance and availability of web
                    services and APIs by controlling the request traffic.

                    - "**Resource Protection:** Ensures that no single user or client could monopolize resources and degrade the performance or impact the experience of other users."
                    - "**Security:** Helps protect against certain types of security attacks, like DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attacks, by limiting the rate at which requests can be made."
                    - "**Cost Management:** Prevents a sharp increase in usage (therefore cost) from either a bug or deliberately heavy usage by a consumer."
                    - "**Quality of Service:** Certain user tiers may be given different rate limits to ensure a level of service. For example, premium users may have a higher rate limit than free users."
                    - "**Enforcing API Tiers/Plans:** Different pricing plans may have different usage limits."
                - type: text
                  text: Rate limits are typically defined on per-second, per-minute, or hourly intervals and are often configurable so they can be finely tuned based on the specific requirements of the system and its users.

                  text: Kong Gateway can be configured to apply rate limiting rules on API traffic entering the system. This includes rate limiting by IP, API key, consumer, or other criteria. This is ideal for handling external API traffic with advanced rate limiting policies and comprehensive traffic management.

Basic rate limiting can be configured for external traffic entering the Kubernetes cluster. This is ideal for controlling external traffic entering your Kubernetes environment with simpler rate limiting requirements.

This includes controlling traffic between microservices and managing inter-service communication. This is ideal for internal service-to-service communication where you need fine-grained control over traffic within the mesh.
