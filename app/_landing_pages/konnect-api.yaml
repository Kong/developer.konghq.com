            You should use the {{site.konnect_short_name}} APIs if one or more of the following is true:
            - You want to manage resources on the Konnect platform and its apps (such as Dev Portal and {{site.konnect_catalog}}) programmatically
            - You need low-level, flexible, and direct integration or automation

            The recommended method of authentication for {{site.konnect_short_name}} is an access token.
            There are two types of access tokens available for {{site.konnect_short_name}}:
            * Personal access tokens associated with user accounts, generated using the [personal access token page](https://cloud.konghq.com/global/account/tokens) in {{site.konnect_short_name}}.
            * System account access tokens associated with system accounts, generated using the [system accounts page](https://cloud.konghq.com/global/organization/system-accounts/)
            or the [Identity API](/api/konnect/identity/#/operations/post-system-accounts-id-access-tokens).

            The access token must be passed in the `Authorization` header of all requests, for example: 

            ```
            curl -X GET 'https://global.api.konghq.com/v2/users/' --header 'Authorization: Bearer kpat_xgfT'
            ```

        blocks:
        - type: text
          config: |
            Personal access tokens (PATs) let you access the {{site.konnect_short_name}} API and CLIs as your personal user account. 
            They are useful for admin tasks, and are the most commonly used and recommended token type. 
            
            When using a PAT, be aware of the following:
            
            * A PAT is granted all of the permissions that the user has access to via their most up-to-date role assignment.
            * The PAT has a maximum duration of 12 months.
            * There is a limit of 10 personal access tokens per user.
            * Unused tokens are deleted and revoked after 12 months of inactivity.
            * A revoked token may be used for up to 15 minutes after revocation.

            Org Admins can revoke personal access tokens for users that leave their organization by using the UI or {{site.konnect_short_name}} API: 
            * **UI:** Navigate to **Organization > Users**, click the user, click the **Personal access tokens** tab
            * **API:** Send a PATCH request to the `/users/{userId}/access-tokens/{tokenId}/revoke` endpoint

    

            Organization Admins can disable the use of PATs by all users by navigating to **Organization > Settings > General**.

        blocks:
        - type: text
          config: |
            A system account is a service account in {{site.konnect_short_name}}, meant to be used for automation and integrations:
            
            * System accounts are intended to be used with APIs and CLIs. 
            They don't have sign-in credentials and can't access the {{site.konnect_short_name}} UI. 
            * System accounts are not associated with an email address, so they aren't attached to any person's identity.
            * When you use a user account as part of an automation or integration and that user leaves the company, automation and integrations break. 
            If you use a system account instead, the automation and integrations wouldn't break.
            * A system account access token (SPAT) has a maximum duration of 12 months.

            An access token created by a system account inherits the roles assigned to the system account, 
            and can be assigned roles directly or inherit the roles of a [team](/konnect-platform/teams-and-roles/).

        blocks:
        - type: text
          config: |
            Managed system accounts, denoted by `konnect_managed:true` in the Identity API, are system accounts whose lifecycle is managed by {{site.konnect_short_name}} instead of the user. 

            {{site.konnect_short_name}} automatically creates a managed system account that is only used to issue a token during the zone creation process. 
            This managed system account can't be edited or deleted manually. 
            Instead, it is deleted automatically by {{site.konnect_short_name}} when the zone is deleted.

            When a token is about to expire, a notification email is sent to all users who have the `create` permission for tokens in the org.
            By default, the following notifications are sent:
          
            * **Expiring**: Reminders are sent 14 days, 7 days, and 1 day before the token expiration date.
            * **Expired**: A notification is sent once the token has expired.

            Each user can toggle these notifications on or off in the [org notification settings](https://cloud.konghq.com/global/notifications/configurations) for personal and system access tokens.
            The timing and target email for the notifications can't be changed.

            The {{site.konnect_short_name}} APIs support the ability to filter over selected collections and only return results that you are interested in. 

            Not every filter operation described here is available in every {{site.konnect_short_name}} API. Specific APIs may support a subset of these options. 
            For the most accurate information on available filters for each API endpoint, always refer to the [individual API specification](/api/).

              When matching against both numeric and timestamp fields, you can filter in the following formats:
          - type: unordered_list
            items:
              - "**Equal**: `?filter[field][eq]=value` or `?filter[field]=value`"
              - "**Contains**: `?filter[field][contains]=value`"
              - "**Less Than**: `?filter[field][lt]=value`"
              - "**Less Than or Equal**: `?filter[field][lte]=value`"
              - "**Greater Than**: `?filter[field][gt]=value`"
              - "**Greater Than or Equal**: `?filter[field][gte]=value`"
          - type: text
            text: |
              If the qualifier is omitted, `?filter[field]=value` for example, the filtering behavior will perform an **exact** style equal match.
