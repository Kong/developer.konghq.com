            You should use the {{site.konnect_short_name}} APIs if one or more of the following is true:
            - You want to manage resources on the Konnect platform and its apps (such as Dev Portal and Service Catalog) programmatically
            - You need low-level, flexible, and direct integration or automation

            The recommended method of authentication for {{site.konnect_short_name}} is an access token.
            There are two types of access tokens available for {{site.konnect_short_name}}:
            * Personal access tokens associated with user accounts, generated using the [personal access token page](https://cloud.konghq.com/global/account/tokens) in {{site.konnect_short_name}}.
            * System account access tokens associated with system accounts, generated using the [system accounts page](https://cloud.konghq.com/global/organization/system-accounts/).
            or the [Identity API](/api/konnect/identity/#/operations/post-system-accounts-id-access-tokens)

            The access token must be passed in the `Authorization` header of all requests, for example: 

            ```
            curl -X GET 'https://global.api.konghq.com/v2/users/' --header 'Authorization: Bearer kpat_xgfT'
            ```

          text: "Personal access tokens"
        blocks:
        - type: text
          config: |
            Personal access tokens (PATs) let you access the Konnect API and CLIs as your personal user account. 
            They are useful for admin tasks, and are the most commonly used and recommended token type.
            
            When using a PAT, be aware of the following:
            
            * A PAT is granted all of the permissions that the user has access to via their most up-to-date role assignment.
            * The PAT has a maximum duration of 12 months.
            * There is a limit of 10 personal access tokens per user.
            * Unused tokens are deleted and revoked after 12 months of inactivity.
      - header:
          type: h3
          text: "System accounts and access tokens"
        blocks:
        - type: text
          config: |
            A system account is a service account in {{site.konnect_short_name}}, meant to be used for automation and integrations:
            
            * System accounts are intended to be used with APIs and CLIs. 
            They don't have sign-in credentials and can't access the {{site.konnect_short_name}} UI. 
            * System accounts are not associated with an email address, so they aren't attached to any person's identity.
            * When you use a user account as part of an automation or integration and that user leaves the company, automation and integrations break. 
            If you use a system account instead, the automation and integrations wouldn't break.

            An access token created by a system account inherits the roles assigned to the system account, 
            and can be assigned roles directly or inherit the roles of a [team](/konnect-platform/teams-and-roles/).

        blocks:
        - type: text
          config: |
            Managed system accounts, denoted by `konnect_managed:true` in the Identity API, are system accounts whose lifecycle is managed by {{site.konnect_short_name}} instead of the user. 

            [Mesh Manager](/mesh-manager/) automatically creates a managed system account that is only used to issue a token during the zone creation process. 
            This managed system account can't be edited or deleted manually. 
            Instead, it is deleted automatically by {{site.konnect_short_name}} when the zone is deleted.

          config: |
            When a token is about to expire, a notification email is sent to all users who have the `create` permission for tokens in the org.
            By default, the following notifications are sent:
          
            * **Expiring**: Reminders are sent 14 days, 7 days, and 1 day before the token expiration date.
            * **Expired**: A notification is sent once the token has expired.

            Each user can toggle these notifications on or off in the [org notification settings](https://cloud.konghq.com/global/notifications/configurations) for personal and system access tokens.
            The timing and target email for the notifications can't be changed.

            The {{site.konnect_short_name}} APIs support the ability to filter over selected collections and only return results that you are interested in. 

            Not every filter operation described here is available in every {{site.konnect_short_name}} API. Specific APIs may support a subset of these options. 
            For the most accurate information on available filters for each API endpoint, always refer to the [individual API specification](/api/).

              When matching against both numeric and timestamp fields, you can filter in the following formats:
          - type: unordered_list
            items:
              - "**Equal**: `?filter[field][eq]=value` or `?filter[field]=value`"
              - "**Contains**: `?filter[field][contains]=value`"
              - "**Less Than**: `?filter[field][lt]=value`"
              - "**Less Than or Equal**: `?filter[field][lte]=value`"
              - "**Greater Than**: `?filter[field][gt]=value`"
              - "**Greater Than or Equal**: `?filter[field][gte]=value`"
          - type: text
            text: |
              If the qualifier is omitted, `?filter[field]=value` for example, the filtering behavior will perform an **exact** style equal match.
