                    Dedicated Cloud Gateways are data plane nodes that are fully managed by Kong in {{site.konnect_short_name}}.
                    
                    You don't need to host any data planes, and you maintain control over the size and location of the gateway infrastructure. 
                    This allows Kong to autoscale your nodes for you and reduces your operational complexity.

                    **Benefits of Dedicated Cloud Gateways:**
                    - {{site.konnect_short_name}} handles gateway upgrades for you.
                    - Choose between public and private networking modes.
                    - Automatic scaling with Autopilot mode.
                    - Support for AWS and Azure in multiple [regions](/konnect-geos/).

                    You can manage your Dedicated Cloud Gateway nodes in [Gateway Manager](https://cloud.konghq.com/gateway-manager/).

                    When you create a Dedicated Cloud Gateway, {{site.konnect_short_name}} creates a **control plane**. 
                    This control plane, like other {{site.konnect_short_name}} control planes, is hosted by {{site.konnect_short_name}}. 

                    You can then deploy data planes in different regions.

                    **Dedicated Cloud Gateway configuration modes:**
                    - **Autopilot Mode:** Configure expected requests per second, and {{site.konnect_short_name}} pre-warms and autoscales the data plane nodes automatically.
                    - **Custom Mode:** Manually specify the instance size, type, and number of nodes per cluster.

                Dedicated Cloud Gateways support both public and private networking on AWS.
                Private networking provides enhanced security by restricting API exposure.
