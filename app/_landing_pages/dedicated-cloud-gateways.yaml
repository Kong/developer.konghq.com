                    Dedicated Cloud Gateways are Data Plane nodes that are fully managed by Kong in {{site.konnect_short_name}}. Each Dedicated Cloud Gateway runs on isolated infrastructure within Kong-managed environments in AWS, Azure, or GCP — offering the performance and security of dedicated infrastructure with the operational ease of SaaS.
                    
                    With Dedicated Cloud Gateways, you don't need to host any Data Planes, and you maintain control over the size and location of the Gateway infrastructure. 
                    This allows Kong to autoscale your nodes for you and reduces your operational complexity.

                    Behind the scenes, every {{site.konnect_short_name}} Dedicated Cloud Gateway runs in an individual single-tenant cloud environment, ensuring consistent performance, tenant isolation, and strong security boundaries. The {{site.konnect_short_name}} Control Plane remains multi-tenant.

                    **Benefits of Dedicated Cloud Gateways:**
                    - {{site.konnect_short_name}} handles Gateway upgrades for you.
                    - Choose between public and private networking modes.
                    - Automatic scaling with Autopilot mode.
                    - Support for AWS, Azure, and GCP in multiple [regions](/konnect-platform/geos/).

                    You can manage your Dedicated Cloud Gateway nodes in the [{{site.konnect_short_name}} UI](https://cloud.konghq.com/gateway-manager/).

                  We recommend using private name resolution for services running in the same cloud as your Dedicated Cloud Gateway. 
                  Use private hosted zones or private DNS if your services are in the same cloud. 
                  Use an outbound DNS resolver if your services are in an external or on-premise DNS server.
