                    You can enable the AI Gateway features through a set of modern and specialized plugins, using the same model you use for any other {{site.base_gateway}} plugin. 
                    When deployed alongside existing {{site.base_gateway}} plugins, {{site.base_gateway}} users can quickly assemble a sophisticated AI management platform without custom code or deploying new and unfamiliar tools.

                    With the growing adoption of AI technologies, developers and their organizations are exposed to a set of new risks. 
                    In particular, the risk of having sensitive data leaked to AI providers, exposing organizations and their customers to data breaches and other security risks.

                    Kong AI Gateway provides additional plugins to help developers control AI data and usage. 
                    These plugins are used in combination with the AI Proxy plugin, allowing you to build secure and specialized AI experiences for your users.

                    AI Gateway provides the ability to govern outgoing AI prompts via an allow/deny list configuration. 
                    Denied prompts result in 4xx HTTP code responses to clients preventing the egress of offending requests.

                    AI systems are built around prompts, and manipulating those prompts is important for successful adoption of the technologies. 
                    Prompt engineering is the methodology of manipulating the linguistic inputs that guide the AI system. 
                    Kong AI Gateway supports a set of plugins that allow you to create a simplified and enhanced experience by setting default prompts or manipulating prompts from clients as they pass through the gateway.

                    AI Gateway allows you to use AI technology to augment other API traffic. 
                    One example is routing API responses through an AI language translation prompt before returning it to the client. 
                    Kong AI Gateway provides two plugins that can be used in conjunction with other upstream API services to weave AI capabilities into API request processing. 
                    These plugins can be configured independently of the AI Proxy plugin.

              a: |
                Yes, AI plugins are supported in all deployment modes, including {{site.konnect_short_name}}, self-hosted traditional, hybrid, and DB-less, and on Kubernetes via the [{{site.kic_product_name}}](/kic/).
            
            - q: Why should I use AI Gateway instead of adding the LLM's API behind {{site.base_gateway}}?
              a: |
                If you just add an LLM's API behind {{site.base_gateway}}, you can only interact at the API level with internal traffic. 
                With AI plugins, {{site.base_gateway}} can understand the prompts that are being sent through the gateway. 
                The plugins can inspect the body and provide more specific AI capabilities to your traffic.
