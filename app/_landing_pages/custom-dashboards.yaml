                    Custom dashboards in {{site.konnect_short_name}} Advanced Analytics allow you to visualize and share key API metrics and insights with flexibility and control. Organization admins can create dashboards manually or automate their provisioning via API and CI/CD.

                    Custom dashboards support:
                    * Templates for fast creation
                    * Reusable definitions for automation
                    * Access control via RBAC roles
                    * Provisioning through Terraform and the {{site.konnect_short_name}} API

              - q: Who can create and manage custom dashboards?
                a: |
                  The Org Admin and Analytics Admin roles can create and manage custom dashboards in {{site.konnect_short_name}}.
              - q: How can I give my team read-only access to dashboards?
                a: |
                  [Assign the Viewer role](/advanced-analytics/custom-dashboards-reference/#Role-based-access) to your team. They will be able to view dashboards shared with their group but not create or edit them.
              - q: Can I automate dashboard creation?
                a: |
                  Yes. You can use the [API](/api/konnect/analytics-dashboards/) or [Terraform](/how-to/automate-dashboard-terraform/) to create dashboards from reusable definitions.
              - q: Once I create a dashboard from a template, can I customize it?
                a: |
                  Yes. Templates are intended as starting points. Once you create a dashboard from a template, you can modify tiles, filters, and layouts as needed.
              - q: Can I download dashboards as PDF?
                a: |
                  PDF export is not yet available, but may be considered in a future release.
              - q: Can I upload my own template?
                a: |
                  Uploading your own template is not yet available, but may be considered in a future release.
