                    Custom dashboards in {{site.konnect_short_name}} {{site.observability}} allow you to visualize and share key API metrics and insights with flexibility and control. Organization admins can create dashboards manually or automate their provisioning via API and CI/CD.

                    Custom dashboards support:
                    * Templates for fast creation
                    * Reusable definitions for automation
                    * Access control via RBAC roles
                    * Provisioning through Terraform and the {{site.konnect_short_name}} API

              - q: Who can create and manage custom dashboards?
                a: |
                  The Org Admin and Analytics Admin roles can create and manage custom dashboards in {{site.konnect_short_name}}.
              - q: How can I give my team read-only access to dashboards?
                a: |
                  [Assign the Viewer role](/observability/custom-dashboards-reference/#role-based-access) to your team. They will be able to view dashboards shared with their group but not create or edit them.

              - q: Can I automate dashboard creation?
                a: |
                  Yes. You can use the [API](/api/konnect/analytics-dashboards/) or [Terraform](/how-to/automate-dashboard-terraform/) to create dashboards from reusable definitions.
              - q: Once I create a dashboard from a template, can I customize it?
                a: |
                  Yes. Templates are intended as starting points. Once you create a dashboard from a template, you can modify tiles, filters, and layouts as needed.
              - q: Can I download dashboards as PDF?
                a: |
                  PDF export is not yet available, but may be considered in a future release.
              - q: Can I upload my own template?
                a: |
                  Uploading your own template is not yet available, but may be considered in a future release.
