                    [{{site.konnect_product_name}}](https://konghq.com/products/kong-konnect)
                    into your engineering organization's technology stack. The platform provides an opinionated framework that will aid you in 
                    designing your {{site.konnect_short_name}} organization and the building of a _Federated APIOps_ delivery process with

                    This document outlines a suggested learning path for using the platform. Start by reading the FAQ section to 
                    understand its components and their purpose. Each component is then explained in detail, with relevant links to 
                    guide you on their usage. You can use individual components as needed, but if you decide the full platform is a 
                    good fit for your organization, follow the how-to guide to set 
                    up an instance connected to your {{site.konnect_short_name}} account and code repositories.

                  | **The {{site.konnect_short_name}} Orchestrator** | A software tool that reconciles declarative configuration with your {{site.konnect_short_name}} organization and manages APIOps code in a _Platform Team_ repository. |
                  | **Kong Air Example Organization** | A complete example demonstrating RP usage, including team structures, service applications, and automated workflows. |
                  | **Service Application Team Self-Service** | _(Coming soon)_ A self-service portal for developer teams to onboard their own services to the platform. |
              - q: "How is automation achieved in the reference platform?"
                a: "The reference platform uses a GitOps-style automation process for API delivery. The {{site.konnect_short_name}} Orchestrator is a tool that can run as a CLI 
                    command or continuous reconciliation loop to apply declarative configurations to your {{site.konnect_short_name}} organizations. The APIOps workflows are installed
                    in your platform repository and are used to manage the API delivery process."
