                    The {{site.konnect_short_name}} Reference Platform is a technical guide that helps you integrate 
                    [{{site.konnect_saas}}](https://konghq.com/products/kong-konnect) into your engineering organization and API delivery process.

                    The platform offers an opinionated framework for designing your {{site.konnect_short_name}} organization and helping to build
                    a _Federated APIOps_ delivery process including governance, auditing, and GitOps based automations. 

                    Included in the platform are tools, examples, best practices, and documentation. How you choose to use the platform 
                    depends on your organization's needs. You can use the materials in these pages as a source for ideas in your own API management systems, 
                    or you can use the tools and how-to guide provided to fully deploy your own {{site.konnect_short_name}} Reference Platform instance.

                    The documentation in the following pages provide extensive details on how the {{site.konnect_short_name}} Reference Platform works and how to use it.
                    Before diving in fully, this overview provides the high level concepts and design. The platform makes some general assumptions about how your 
                    engineering organization is structured and the types of automations you  may wish to use. If these assumptions do not fit your needs, 
                    you can still use the materials as a reference for building your own specialized API delivery platform.

                     <b>Platform Team</b>: The Platform Team is a common enginering organization design, where a team owns the _platform_ upon which  
                     development teams deploy their applications. In the reference platform, the platform team owns the API delivery process and the supporting
                     code and automations to enable it.

                     <b>Development Teams</b>: The Development Teams own the application services and APIs. In the current version of the reference platform,
                     they are isolated from Kong services and the API delivery process. The platform team sources API specifications from the development teams
                     and delivers them to {{site.konnect_short_name}} on their behalf.

                     <b>Organizations & Environments</b>: The reference platform supports multiple organizations and environments. Organizations are are used to
                     associate a set of teams and their applications to a {{site.konnect_short_name}} Organization. Within each organization, you can define
                     environments which represent a further logical grouping of {{site.konnect_short_name}} resources. By default, "Development" and "Production" 
                     environments are created for each organization.

                  text: |
                     <b>APIOps</b>: In the reference platform, APIs are delivered from the development teams to {{site.konnect_short_name}} and {{site.base_gateway}} 
                     following APIOps & GitOps based principles. Pull Requests and review based processes are used to provide automations with governance procedures ensuring
                     auditable and repeatble API delivery.

                     <b>Declarative Config</b>: The reference platform is designed around a declarative configuration format that is used to define your desired
                     state of {{site.konnect_short_name}} resources. Within the APIOps process, `koctl` reads and 
                     reconciles the declarative configuration and applies it to a {{site.konnect_short_name}} organization.

                     <b>Konnect Orchestrator (koctl)</b>: The `koctl` tool is a multi-purpose CLI tool used to enable the features of the reference platform. You can use
                     the tool to initialize your platform repository, install the APIOps workflows, and apply declarative configuration to your {{site.konnect_short_name}} organizations.
                     By default `koctl` runs within the APIOps workflows of the platform repository.

                    The {{site.konnect_short_name}} Reference Platform is designed as a versatile reference for helping you build an
                    API delivery platform that suits your specific organization. Engineering organizations are unique in their needs,
                    and no single solution will be a perfect fit for every environment.

                    The platform contains various materials that can be used indivdiually or together to build a 
                    complete API delivery platform. You may start by simply reviewing the documentation, 
                    code, and APIOps workflows provided and apply the concepts to your own systems. Alternatively, you may choose to 
                    fully use the {{site.konnect_short_name}} Orchestrator and build your own API Platform based 
                    on the tools and guidance provided in the platform [how-to guide](/konnect-reference-platform/how-to/).

                    The following sections provide details on the various components and how to use them.

                  `koctl` is a multi-purpose tool used to setup and apply the {{site.konnect_short_name}} 
                  Reference Platform concepts to your engineering processes. 
                  
                  The `koctl` tool can be installed on your development machine and used to initialize and configure a centralized platform git repository 
                  which will operate the API delivery process. `koctl` is also used within the APIOps workflows to apply declarative configuration to 
                  your {{site.konnect_short_name}} organizations. This capability is built in to the workflows installed by `koctl` itself.

                  The [Konnect Orchestrator](/konnect-reference-platform/orchestrator) page provides a complete overview of the tool, including installation 
                  instructions and usage examples.

                    The reference platform provides an example implementation with [Kong Air](https://github.com/KongAirlines), 
                    a fictional airline company. Kong Air's development teams provides a set of APIs related to destinations, flights, and 
                    other travel-related services.

                    The example is hosted in GitHub and is made up of source code repositories that mimic a multi-team and multi-service engineering 
                    organization. The "Kong Air engineering team" has implemented the reference platform centered around the 
                    central [platform git repository](https://github.com/KongAirlines/platform).
                    
                    The example s built using the `koctl` tool is designed to be a complete example of how to implement the 
                    {{site.konnect_short_name}} Reference Platform.

                  The {{site.konnect_short_name}} Reference Platform provides a set of API delivery automations via 
                  CI/CD based workflows. The workflows are installed by the `koctl` tool into your centralized platform repository
                  and provide the necessary steps to deliver an API from your developer team repositories to your {{site.konnect_short_name}} 
                  organization.

                  The workflows implement a multi-step process for API delivery. The process is specifically designed to utilize Pull Request
                  based processes ensuring that all changes are reviewed and approved before being applied to your {{site.konnect_short_name}} 
                  organization.

                  The how-to guide provides the step-by-step instructions for deploying the {{site.konnect_short_name}} Reference Platform
                  to your own environment. The guide is designed to be a complete reference for platform engineers to integrate 
                  {{site.konnect_product_name}} into their engineering organization and API delivery process. 
                  
                  Included in the guide are required prerequisites and security configurations for {{site.konnect_short_name}} and your 
                  git repositories. Once the steps are completed, you will have a fully functional API delivery platform that 
                  can deliver APIs from your developer team repositories to your {{site.konnect_short_name}} organization.
