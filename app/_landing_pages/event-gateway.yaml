                    The event gateway is composed of two core branches: protocol mediation using the {{site.base_gateway}} and
                    native event processing using the {{site.event_gateway}}.

                    Protocol mediation enables HTTP clients to produce to and consume from event streams. 
                    
                    These are features of the Kong API Gateway and include functionality such as producing and consuming to and from Kafka topics via `http-get` or SSE.

                    In {{site.base_gateway}}, we provide multiple plugins to produce and consume data for Kafka.

                    {{site.event_gateway_short}} is a proxy for the native Kafka protocol that sits between native consumers and producers and backend Kafka clusters. 
                    It supports features such as cluster virtualization, authentication mediation, and encryption of message payloads + keys.

                    Through its extensible policy engine, you can augment, optimize, and secure 
                    your Kafka deployments with customized business logic to transform, encrypt, and observe Kafka messages. 
                    
                    The {{site.event_gateway}} supports many policies such as
                    encryption, cluster virtualization, message filtering, and more.
