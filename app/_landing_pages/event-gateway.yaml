                    The Kong Native Event Proxy (KNEP) is a proxy for Apache Kafka, which can run in front of any
                    Kafka cluster. 

                    Through it's extensible policy engine, users can augment, optimize, and secure 
                    their Kafka deployments with customized business logic to transform, encrypt, and observe Kafka messages. 
                    
                    The Native Event Proxy supports many policies such as
                    encryption, cluster virtualization, message filtering, and more.
