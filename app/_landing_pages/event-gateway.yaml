                   {{ site.event_gateway }} is a lightweight, fast, and flexible cloud-native event streaming proxy. 
                    It sits between Kafka clients and backend Kafka clusters. 

                    With its extensible policy engine, you can adapt Kafka to your requirements-transforming, encrypting, and monitoring 
                    messages through a central proxy to add governance, enable multi-tenancy, and strengthen security.
                    
                    {{ site.event_gateway }} runs in front of any Kafka cluster and can be extended through policies and plugins.

            You can configure {{site.event_gateway_short}} using {{site.konnect_short_name}}.

            Before deploying {{site.event_gateway_short}}, ensure that you have a Kafka cluster.

              content: |
                You can use the [quickstart script](https://get.konghq.com/event-gateway) to get a demo instance of Event Gateway running almost instantly.
                
                This command requires a [Konnect Access Token](https://cloud.konghq.com/global/account/tokens).

                ```sh
                curl -Ls https://get.konghq.com/event-gateway | bash -s -- -k $KONNECT_TOKEN
                ```

                The script creates an Event Gateway control plane in Konnect and deploys a local data plane using Docker.

                All licensing is handled automatically by Konnect.

              content: |
                To set up Event Gateway using the Konnect UI, use the following steps:
                1. Sign in to your Konnect account at [cloud.konghq.com](https://cloud.konghq.com/).
                1. In the menu, navigate to **Event Gateway**.
                1. Click **New Gateway**.
                1. Fill in the required fields.
                1. Click **Create** to save.
                1. Select a platform for your data plane.
                1. Click **Generate Certificate**.
                1. Copy the generated command.
                1. Run the command on your data plane host to start the data plane.
                1. After the data plane is connected and the control plane recognizes it, click **Done**.

              a: |
                The {{site.event_gateway}} data planes are self-managed and deployed by you, the user. 
                The {{site.event_gateway}} control plane is part of the {{site.konnect_product_name}} platform.
            
            - q: Does {{site.event_gateway}} run on-prem?
              a: No, {{site.event_gateway}} is only available through the {{site.konnect_product_name}} platform.
            
            - q: Can I proxy multiple Kafka clusters?
              a: |
                Yes, the gateway can proxy multiple backend clusters, though only one can currently be proxied in a single client connection.
