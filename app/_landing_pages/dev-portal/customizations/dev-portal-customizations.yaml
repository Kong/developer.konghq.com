                    You can customize your Dev Portals with the following features:
                    - Configure layout, navigation, branding, and domain settings.
                    - Build content-rich pages with Markdown Components, nest information, and reuse snippets.
                    - Manage page visibility, publishing workflow, and SEO metadata.
                    - Customize global appearance, apply custom CSS, and set up menus and navigation structures.
                    - Set up and manage custom domains, SSL certificates, and URL paths.

                    The preview will automatically show what your page should look like when developers view your Dev Portal. In the event that it fails to refresh after editing the page, there is a refresh button next to the generated URL at the bottom.

                    There are three icons above **Preview** that allow you to test adaptive designs in some predefined viewports:
                    * Desktop
                    * Tablet

                    In your Dev Portal, you can create pages that contain content such as text, buttons, tabs, and more. 
                    Pages are used to convey information about your API and Dev Portal to users. 
                    They are highly customizable using Markdown Components (MDC), allowing you to create nested page structures to organize pages and generate URLs or slugs. 
                    You can also stage new pages or restrict access to logged-in developers by using visibility controls and publishing status. 
                    
                    To configure pages and content, navigate to your Dev Portal in {{site.konnect_short_name}} and click **Portal Editor** in the sidebar. 
                    In the Portal Editor sidebar, click the folder icon.

                    Appearance settings are applied globally to all pages in your Dev Portal. For advanced needs, you can also create custom CSS that applies custom styles to your Dev Portal. Custom CSS provides global customization to all pages in Dev Portal.
                    To configure appearance settings, navigate to your Dev Portal in {{site.konnect_short_name}} and click **Portal Editor** in the sidebar. In the Portal Editor sidebar, click the paint bucket icon.

                    Basic appearance settings quickly create basic styles for your default Portal template:

                    You can configure the main menu, footer, and footer bottom navigation menus in your Dev Portal. 
                    To configure navigation settings, navigate to your Dev Portal in {{site.konnect_short_name}} and click **Portal Editor** in the sidebar. 
                    In the Portal Editor sidebar, click the menu tree icon.

                    * **Main menu**: Main menus are a flat list of links that will be added to the header of every page in your Dev Portal. These titles and links will be spaced evenly horizontally. You can also add external links to all Dev Portal menu items either using the {{site.konnect_short_name}} UI or the [`/portals/{portalId}/customization` endpoint](/api/konnect/portal-management/v3/#/operations/update-portal-customization).
                    * **Footer menu sections**: Footer menus allow you to create a set of columns with links for global navigation. Select **Footer Sections Menu** from the dropdown list to begin creating your menus. Footer sections create vertical columns across the bottom of every page, with the logo from [Appearance](#appearance) on the left side. We recommend creating your desired footer sections before creating footer menu items. Footer menu items are links to any URL you prefer, with a title to be displayed. Items must specify a footer menu section.
                    * **Footer bottom menu**: Footer bottom menu is a flat list of links that will be added to the bottom of every page. Footer bottom menus are placed below footer menu sections.
