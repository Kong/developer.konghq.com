            The Admin API is an internal RESTful API designed for administration purposes. It provides full control over {{site.base_gateway}}.

            Requests to the Admin API can be sent to any node in the cluster, and Kong will keep the configuration consistent across all nodes.

            By default, the Admin API is exposed on the following ports:
            * 8001 for HTTP
            * 8444 for HTTPS

            This can be customized with the `admin_listen` parameter in in the [{{site.base_gateway}} configuration](/gateway/configuration/#admin-listen).

          config: |
            You should use the Admin API if one or more of the following is true:
            - You're running {{site.base_gateway}} on-prem with a database
            - You need low-level, flexible, and direct integration or automation
            - You want granular access to all {{site.base_gateway}} entities
            - You want to interact with {{site.base_gateway}} through Insomnia
            
            If you're using {{site.konnect_short_name}}, you should use the [{{site.konnect_short_name}} API](/konnect-api/) instead.

              {{ site.base_gateway }} is a low-demand, high-performing API gateway. 
              You can set up {{ site.base_gateway }} with {{site.konnect_short_name}}, or install it on various self-managed systems.

              This tutorial will help you get started with {{ site.base_gateway }} by setting up either a {{site.konnect_short_name}} hybrid deployment or self-managed local installation and walking through some common API management tasks.

        - type: faqs
          config:
            - q: Does the Kong Admin API work with Gateway entities in {{site.konnect_short_name}}?
              a: It does not. All of the apps in {{site.konnect_short_name}} have their own APIs. To manage entities in the Gateway Manager, you can use the [Konnect Control Plane Config API](/api/konnect/control-planes-config/v2/).
            - q: Can I use the Admin API in DB-less mode?
              a: |
                In DB-less mode, you configure {{site.base_gateway}} declaratively. The Admin API for each {{site.base_gateway}} node functions independently, reflecting the memory state of that particular node. 
                This is the case because there is no database coordination between nodes. Therefore, the Admin API is mostly read-only.

                When running {{site.base_gateway}} in DB-less mode, the Admin API can only perform tasks related to handling the declarative config:
                * [Validating configurations against schemas](/api/gateway/admin-ee/#/operations/post-schemas-entity-validate)
                * [Validating plugin configurations against schemas](/api/gateway/admin-ee/#/operations/post-schemas-plugins-validate)
                * [Reloading the declarative configuration](/api/gateway/admin-ee/#/operations/post-config)
            
            - q: How can I send a request for a specific Workspace?
              a: |
                You can target a specific Workspace by prefixing any endpoint with the Workspace name or ID. For example, you can use the following command to get all services from a Workspace named `SRE`:
                ```sh
                curl -i -X GET http://localhost:8001/SRE/services
                ```

                If no Workspace is specified, the request applies to the `default` Workspace.
