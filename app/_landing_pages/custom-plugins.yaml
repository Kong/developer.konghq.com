                    Kong provides a development environment for developing plugins, 
                    including Plugin Development Kits (or PDKs), database abstractions, migrations, and more.

                    Plugins consist of modules interacting with the request/response objects or
                    streams via a PDK to implement arbitrary logic. With custom plugins, you can configure these modules to provide custom functionality to {{site.base_gateway}}.
