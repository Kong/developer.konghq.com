                    Kong provides a development environment for developing plugins, 
                    including Plugin Development Kits (or PDKs), database abstractions, migrations, and more.

                    Plugins consist of modules interacting with the request/response objects or
                    streams via a PDK to implement arbitrary logic. With custom plugins, you can configure these modules to provide custom functionality to {{site.base_gateway}}.

                The Plugin Development Kit (PDK) is a set of Lua functions and variables
                that can be used by plugins to implement their own logic.

                    Through partnerships with third parties, Kong lists some [third-party custom plugins](/plugins/?support=third-party) on the Kong Plugin Hub. 
                    These plugins are maintained by Kong partners. 
                    If you would like to have your plugin featured on the Kong Plugin Hub, we encourage you to become a [Kong Partner](https://konghq.com/partners).
