                    Kong provides an entire development environment for developing plugins, 
                    including Plugin Development Kits (or PDKs), database abstractions, migrations, and more.

                    Plugins consist of modules interacting with the request/response objects or
                    streams via a PDK to implement arbitrary logic. With custom plugins, you can configure these modules to provide custom functionality to Kong Gateway.

                    To start creating your own plugins, review the [Getting Started documentation](https://docs.konghq.com/gateway/latest/plugin-development/get-started/),
                    or see the following references:
                    * [Plugin Development Kit reference](https://docs.konghq.com/gateway/latest/plugin-development/pdk/)
                    * [Other Language Support](https://docs.konghq.com/gateway/latest/plugin-development/pluginserver/go/)

                    Through partnerships with third parties, Kong lists some [third-party custom plugins](https://docs.konghq.com/hub/?support=third-party-partner%2Ccommunity) on the Kong Plugin Hub. 
                    These plugins are maintained by Kong partners. 
                    If you would like to have your plugin featured on the Kong Plugin Hub, we encourage you to become a [Kong Partner](https://konghq.com/partners/).
