                    Kong provides a development environment for developing plugins, 
                    including Plugin Development Kits (or PDKs), database abstractions, migrations, and more.

                    Plugins consist of modules interacting with the request/response objects or
                    streams via a PDK to implement arbitrary logic. With custom plugins, you can configure these modules to provide custom functionality to {{site.base_gateway}}.

                    To start creating your own plugins, review the [getting started documentation](#get-started),
                    or see the following references:
                    * [Plugin Development Kit reference](https://docs.konghq.com/gateway/latest/plugin-development/pdk/)
                    * [Other Language Support](https://docs.konghq.com/gateway/latest/plugin-development/pluginserver/go/)

                    Through partnerships with third parties, Kong lists some [third-party custom plugins](/plugins/?support=third-party) on the Kong Plugin Hub. 
                    These plugins are maintained by Kong partners. 
                    If you would like to have your plugin featured on the Kong Plugin Hub, we encourage you to become a [Kong Partner](https://konghq.com/partners).

                    Learn about custom plugin development by following a series of tutorials that walk you through all the steps to build a new custom plugin for {{site.base_gateway}}.
                    The plugin you build will transform HTTP traffic as it passes through the API gateway, and give you
                    a solid starting point for building custom plugins to solve your specific business needs.

                    You will learn how to:
                    * Set up a new plugin project
                    * Build automated tests for your custom plugins
                    * Add plugin configuration to the project allowing for runtime behavior changes
                    * Consume external services from within your plugin 
                    * Deploy your plugin
