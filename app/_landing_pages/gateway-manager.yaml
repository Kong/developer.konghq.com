                    Gateway Manager is a {{site.konnect_short_name}} module that lets you catalog, connect to, and monitor 
                    the status of all Control Planes (CPs) and Data Plane nodes (DPs) in one place.
                    
                    With Gateway Manager, you can:
                    - Manage Control Planes and their configurations
                    - Deploy and monitor Data Plane nodes
                    - Use fully-managed cloud gateways or self-hosted infrastructure
                    - Ensure high availability, security, and scalability for your API traffic

                      **{{site.base_gateway}} Control Planes**

                      Every [region](/konnect-platform/geos/) in every organization starts with one default Control Plane. 
                      With {{site.konnect_short_name}}, you can configure additional {{site.base_gateway}} Control Planes, 
                      each of which will have isolated configuration. Use multiple Control Planes in one 
                      {{site.konnect_short_name}} organization to manage Data Plane nodes and their configuration 
                      in any groupings you want.

                    items:
                      - "**Environment separation:** Split environments based on their purpose, such as development, staging, and production."
                      - "**Region separation:** Assign each Control Plane to a region or group of regions. Spin up Data Plane nodes in those regions for each Control Plane."
                      - "**Team separation:** Dedicate each Control Plane to a different team and share resources based on team purpose."
                      - "**Resource hosting and management separation:** Run a hybrid Control Plane with self-hosted Data Plane nodes, and a separate Dedicated Cloud Gateway Control Plane with Kong-managed nodes."
