                    Gateway Manager is a {{site.konnect_saas}} module that lets you catalog, connect to, and monitor 
                    the status of all control planes (CPs) and data plane nodes (DPs) in one place.
                    
                    With Gateway Manager, you can:
                    - Manage control planes and their configurations
                    - Deploy and monitor data plane nodes
                    - Use fully-managed cloud gateways or self-hosted infrastructure
                    - Ensure high availability, security, and scalability for your API traffic
                    
                    For more information, read the [Gateway Manager Reference](/gateway-manager/reference)

                      **Kong Gateway Control Planes**  
                      Every [region](/konnect-geos/) in every organization starts with one default control plane. 
                      With {{site.konnect_short_name}}, you can configure additional Kong Gateway control planes, 
                      each of which will have isolated configuration. Use multiple control planes in one 
                      {{site.konnect_short_name}} organization to manage data plane nodes and their configuration 
                      in any groupings you want.

                      Some common use cases for using multiple control planes include:

                    items:
                      - "**Environment separation:** Split environments based on their purpose, such as development, staging, and production."
                      - "**Region separation:** Assign each control plane to a region or group of regions. Spin up data plane nodes in those regions for each control plane."
                      - "**Team separation:** Dedicate each control plane to a different team and share resources based on team purpose."
                      - "**Resource hosting and management separation:** Run a hybrid control plane with self-hosted data plane nodes, and a separate Dedicated Cloud Gateway control plane with Kong-managed nodes."
