                    Kong's AI assistant, KAi, can detect issues, suggest fixes, and accelerate your workflows all without leaving the {{site.konnect_short_name}} UI.
                    KAi is enabled by default for {{site.konnect_short_name}} Plus and trial accounts.
                    KAi is always disabled by default for Enterprise accounts.
                    Enterprise accounts can enable KAi by contacting their Kong account manager or [enabling it in {{site.konnect_short_name}} Labs](https://cloud.konghq.com/global/organization/labs).

                    KAi can help you do the following:
                    * **Find information on {{site.konnect_short_name}}:** Ask questions about {{site.konnect_short_name}} features, settings and configurations.
                    * **Explore gateway entities:** View and explore API gateway entities: Services, Routes, plugins, and more.
                    * **Debug and analyze API traffic:** Get real-time insights and troubleshoot performance bottlenecks and issues.

                  KAi is made up of a series of components running inside {{site.konnect_short_name}}.
                  The agent can perform smart orchestration and analysis of {{site.konnect_short_name}} data and entities.
                  You can interact with the agent in the following ways:
                  * Use the chat in the {{site.konnect_short_name}} UI by clicking **Ask KAi** on the top right.
                  * Use the `kongctl` command-line tool with the `kongctl kai` command.

                  The KAi agent uses backend LLMs for reasoning and natural language tasks. It also uses a {{site.konnect_short_name}} MCP server to provide information about {{site.konnect_short_name}} and the user's entities and data.
                  Because the MCP server is authenticated via the logged-in user's session, it only has access to data and resources that the user themselves has permission to access.

                  KAi also has access to Kong's documentation and support knowledge base, so it can provide guidance on configuration, architecture, and troubleshooting.

                  Like other AI chatbots, KAi uses sessions. 
                  KAi can remember context within a session while the data is retained, but doesn't share context between sessions. 
                  You can have a maximum of three current sessions with KAi.

                  To start a chat with KAi, click **Ask KAi** on the top right of the {{site.konnect_short_name}} UI.

                  KAi is context-sensitive, so if you navigate to a control plane or Gateway Service, KAi will use that entity context to answer questions. We recommend adding context, like your control plane, to get the best possible answer from KAi.
                  You can create a new session from the **Active session** dropdown menu by selecting "New conversation". Each user is limited to three sessions. To delete a session, click the action menu icon next to the session and click **Delete**.

                  The same {{site.konnect_short_name}} MCP Server that powers KAi is available for use with external AI assistants and IDE copilots. This allows you to interact with your {{site.konnect_short_name}} resources directly from your development environment.

                  With the MCP server, you can:
                  * Query gateway entities (control planes, services, routes, consumers, plugins)
                  * Create and analyze debug sessions for performance issues
                  * Search Kong documentation
                  * Analyze API traffic

      - blocks:
        - type: faqs
          config:
            - q: Is the KAi AI assistant enabled by default?
              a: It is enabled by default for {{site.konnect_short_name}} Plus and trial accounts. Only organization owners can choose to enable or disable KAi for an organization. KAi is always disabled by default for Enterprise accounts. Enterprise accounts can enable it by contacting their Kong account manager or by [enabling it in {{site.konnect_short_name}} Labs](https://cloud.konghq.com/global/organization/labs).
            - q: Does KAi automatically modify {{site.konnect_short_name}} configuration when it finds an issue?
              a: No. KAi will ask for your permission before making any changes to {{site.konnect_short_name}} configuration. You can also approve modifications on a per session basis.
            - q: Can all users see the same resources with the AI assistant KAi?
              a: No. Users can only see the {{site.konnect_short_name}} entities in KAi that they have permissions to via [teams and roles](/konnect-platform/teams-and-roles/). For example, if a user is a Portal Admin, they can see Dev Portal entities, but they can't ask KAi about control planes.
            - q: Is there an additional cost to using KAi?
              a: During the Beta period, access to KAi is included in your existing Plus and Trial plans. Enterprise users should contact their Kong account manager or [enable it in {{site.konnect_short_name}} Labs](https://cloud.konghq.com/global/organization/labs).
            - q: Does KAi train on any of my data?
              a: No. Neither Kong nor any downstream LLMs that KAi uses train on user data.
            - q: Which models does KAi use?
              a: We currently use Anthropic Claude provided by AWS Bedrock. Review the Terms for Anthropic on the [AWS Third-Party Models page](https://aws.amazon.com/legal/bedrock/third-party-models/).
            - q: What regions is KAi available in?
              a: KAi is currently available in US, EU, and AU. Other regions will be added as the product moves out of Beta.
