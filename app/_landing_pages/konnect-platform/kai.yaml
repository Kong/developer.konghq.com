                    {{site.konnect_short_name}}'s AI assistant, KAi, can detect issues, suggest remediations, and accelerate your workflows all without leaving the {{site.konnect_short_name}} UI.
                    You can enable KAi by contacting your Kong account manager. 

                    KAi can help you do the following:
                    * Investigate why an API is slow
                    * See which Consumer has the highest usage for the API
                    * With your permission, modify {{site.konnect_short_name}}'s configuration to fix any detected issues

          config:
            - q: Is the KAi AI assistant disabled by default?
              a: Yes. You can enable it by contacting your Kong account manager.
            - q: Does KAi automatically modify {{site.konnect_short_name}} configuration when it finds an issue?
              a: No. KAi will ask for your permission before making any changes to {{site.konnect_short_name}} configuration. You can also approve modifications on a per session basis.
            - q: Can all users see and modify the same resources with the AI assistant KAi?
              a: No. Users can only see and modify {{site.konnect_short_name}} entities in KAi that they have permissions to via [teams and roles](/konnect-platform/teams-and-roles/). For example, if a user is a Portal Admin, they can see and modify Dev Portal entities, but they can't ask KAi about control planes or modify control planes.
