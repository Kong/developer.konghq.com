                    Kong's AI assistant, KAi, can detect issues, suggest remediation, and accelerate your workflows all without leaving the {{site.konnect_short_name}} UI.
                   KAi is enabled by default for {{site.konnect_short_name}} Plus and trial accounts. 
                    KAi is always disabled by default for Enterprise accounts. 
                    Enterprise accounts can enable it by contacting their Kong account manager.

                    KAi can help you do the following:
                    * Run a debug session to analyze API performance issues
                    * Provides recommendations to improve API performance
                    * Answer any {{site.konnect_short_name}} questions using the Kong Docs

            - q: Is the KAi AI assistant enabled by default?
              a: It is enabled by default for {{site.konnect_short_name}} Plus and trial accounts. KAi is always disabled by default for Enterprise accounts. Enterprise accounts can enable it by contacting their Kong account manager.
            - q: Does KAi automatically modify {{site.konnect_short_name}} configuration when it finds an issue?
              a: No. KAi will ask for your permission before making any changes to {{site.konnect_short_name}} configuration. You can also approve modifications on a per session basis.
            - q: Can all users see the same resources with the AI assistant KAi?
              a: No. Users can only see the {{site.konnect_short_name}} entities in KAi that they have permissions to via [teams and roles](/konnect-platform/teams-and-roles/). For example, if a user is a Portal Admin, they can see Dev Portal entities, but they can't ask KAi about control planes.
