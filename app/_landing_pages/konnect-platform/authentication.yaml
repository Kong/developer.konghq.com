                  The default authentication option in {{site.konnect_short_name}} is basic authentication, where users can log in with a username and password. Users can also set up passkeys when they log into {{site.konnect_short_name}} using their username and password.
                  
                  Users can also register for and sign in to {{site.konnect_short_name}} accounts using their social identity from the following providers:
                  * Google
                  * GitHub
                  * Microsoft

                  **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: MFA is only required for {{site.konnect_short_name}} Plus and Enterprise users. 
                  {{site.konnect_short_name}} Plus and Enterprise users signing in with built-in authentication (i.e. using username and password) are prompted to set up MFA the first time that they sign in to {{site.konnect_short_name}}. 
                  New {{site.konnect_short_name}} signups using basic authentication can opt in to MFA during sign-up or later through the organization settings. 
                  MFA is recommended for all {{site.konnect_short_name}} organizations regardless of the organization tier as a security best practice.  
                  If you need to reset your MFA, reach out to [Kong Support](https://support.konghq.com).
