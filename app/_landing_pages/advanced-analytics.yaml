                    The [summary dashboard](https://cloud.konghq.com/us/analytics/summary) shows performance and health statistics of all your APIs across your organization on a 
                    single page and provides insights into your Service usage. 

                    Manage data ingestion from any **Control Plane Dashboard** using the **Advanced Analytics** toggle. 
                    This toggle lets you enable or disable data collection for your API traffic per Control Plane.

                    **Modes:**
                    - **On:** Both basic and advanced analytics data is collected, allowing in-depth insights and reporting.
                    - **Off:** Advanced analytics collection stops, but basic API metrics remain available in Gateway Manager, 
                    and can still be used for custom reports.

                    You can assign users to predefined [**Analytics teams** in {{site.konnect_short_name}}](/konnect-platform/teams-and-roles/) to control access levels. 
                    This allows specific users to **view** or **manage** Analytics independently.
