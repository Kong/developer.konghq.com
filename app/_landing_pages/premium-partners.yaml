                    With Kafka at its core, [Confluent](https://www.confluent.io/) offers complete, fully-managed, cloud-native data streaming that's available 
                    everywhere your data and applications reside.

                    Kong provides integrations with Confluent through two plugins: Confluent and Confluent Consume.

                Using the **Confluent plugin**, you can send HTTP request data to Apache Kafka by constructing Kafka messages from incoming {{site.base_gateway}} HTTP requests.

                With this plugin, you can:
                * Publish messages to Confluent topics
                * Set custom timeouts
                * Use SASL authentication
                * Choose to include or exclude the headers, body, URI, and method of the request in the message

                Using the **Confluent Consume plugin**, {{site.base_gateway}} can consume messages from Confluent Cloud Kafka topics and make them available through HTTP endpoints.

                With this plugin, you can:
                * Consume messages from Confluent topics via HTTP GET requests
                * Stream messages using Server-Sent Events
                * Set custom timeouts
                * Use SASL authentication

                    API-driven world. 

                    Traceable is the only contextually-informed solution that powers complete API security— security posture management, 
                    threat protection and threat management across the entire Software Development Lifecycle— enabling organizations to

                **Traceable's Kong plugin** lets Traceable capture a copy of the API traffic that is flowing through {{site.base_gateway}}. 
                Using this data, Traceable is able to create a security posture profile of APIs hosted on Kong. 

                Based on its findings, the Traceable plugin can also block traffic coming from malicious actors and IPs into {{site.base_gateway}}.

                With [{{site.konnect_catalog}}](/catalog/), you gain visibility into all your Traceable services, including unrecognized or undiscovered APIs in your organization.

                Using Traceable through the {{site.konnect_short_name}} {{site.konnect_catalog}}, you can 
                manage and secure services that Traceable discovers by analyzing API traffic across your entire application landscape.
