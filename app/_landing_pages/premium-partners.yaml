           Traceable's Kong plugin lets Traceable capture a copy of the API traffic that is flowing through Kong Gateway. 
           Using this data, Traceable is able to create a security posture profile of APIs hosted on Kong. 

           Based on its findings, the Traceable plugin can also block traffic coming from malicious actors and IPs into Kong Gateway.
