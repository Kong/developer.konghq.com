                    Service Catalog provides a centralized catalog of all services running in your organization. 
                    By integrating with internal applications (like Gateway Manager and Mesh Manager) and external tools (like GitHub and PagerDuty), 
                    it offers a 360-degree overview of your services, including:

              - q: "What if I notice discrepancies in Service Catalog data?"
                a: "Check integration settings, verify connected tools, and ensure data synchronization is working correctly."
