                    it offers a 360-degree overview of your services, including:

              - q: "How do Service Catalog services map to API products?"
                a: "Service Catalog services do not directly map to API products. However, a Gateway Service can be linked to a Service Catalog service, which can then be associated with an API product."
              - q: "How do I view service health and status?"
                a: "Go to **Services** in the Service Catalog and select a service to view detailed health and status information."
              - q: "How can I identify available resources for mapping?"
                a: "Visit the **Resources** page in the Service Catalog to see all available ingested resources."
              - q: "What if I notice discrepancies in Service Catalog data?"
                a: "Check integration settings, verify connected tools, and ensure data synchronization is working correctly."
              - q: "Can I control access to specific Service Catalog data?"
                a: "Yes, access can be managed through [teams and roles](/konnect-platform/teams-and-roles/)."
