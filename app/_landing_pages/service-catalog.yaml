                    Service Catalog provides a centralized catalog of all services and APIs running in your organization. 
                    By integrating with internal applications (like Gateway Manager and Mesh Manager) and external tools (like GitHub and PagerDuty), 
                    it offers a 360-degree overview of your services, including:

                    - Service ownership details
                    - Upstream and downstream dependencies
                    - Associated code repositories and CI/CD pipelines
                    - API gateway and service mesh mappings
                    - Comprehensive API catalog
