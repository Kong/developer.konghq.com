                    The [summary dashboard](https://cloud.konghq.com/us/analytics/summary) shows performance and health statistics of all your APIs across your organization on a 
                    single page and provides insights into your Service usage. 

                    Manage data ingestion from any **Control Plane Dashboard** using the **{{site.observability}}** toggle. 
                    This toggle lets you enable or disable data collection for your API traffic per control plane.

                    **Modes:**
                    - **On:** Both basic and advanced analytics data is collected, allowing in-depth insights and reporting.
                    - **Off:** Advanced analytics collection stops, but basic API metrics remain available for API Gateway, 
                    and can still be used for custom reports.
                    
                    {{site.observability}} includes the ability to build organization-specific views with [Custom Dashboards](/custom-dashboards/).
                    You can create them from scratch or use existing templates. The functionality is powered by a robust [API](/api/konnect/analytics-dashboards/), and [Terraform integration](/how-to/automate-dashboard-terraform/).
