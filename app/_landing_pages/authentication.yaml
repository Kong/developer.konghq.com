                  Authentication is the process of verifying that a requester has permissions to access a resource. 
                  As its name implies, API gateway authentication controls the flow of data between clients and the gateway.
                  
                  With {{site.base_gateway}} controlling authentication, requests wonâ€™t reach upstream services unless the client has successfully authenticated. 
                  This means upstream services process pre-authorized requests, freeing them from the cost of authentication, which 
                  is a savings in compute time and development effort.

                  {{site.base_gateway}} has a library of plugins that support the most widely used methods of API gateway authentication.

                  Basic authentication is a simple authentication method that uses a base64-encoded username and password combination as token.

                  Key authentication generates an API key for a consumer, which can be passed in an `apikey` header to access services and routes.

                  OpenID Connect (OIDC) is an authentication protocol based on OAuth 2.0. It works with identity providers to verify a user's identity without storing credentials.

                  {{site.base_gateway}} authentication plugins protect your upstream services from unauthorized access. This means upstream services process pre-authorized requests, freeing them from the cost of authentication, which is a savings in compute time and development effort.

                  {{site.base_gateway}} offers tools that give visibility into all authentication attempts, which provides the ability to build monitoring and alerting capabilities supporting service availability and compliance.

              KIC relies on {{site.base_gateway}}'s Plugins, but configuring them with {{site.kic_product_name}} is different. 
              
              Rather than attaching a configuration directly to a service or route, you create a KongPlugin definition and then annotate your 
              Kubernetes resource with the `konghq.com/plugins` annotation.
