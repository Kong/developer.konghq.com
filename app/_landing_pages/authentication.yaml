                    Authentication is the process of verifying that a requester has permissions to access a resource. 
                    As its name implies, API gateway authentication authenticates the flow of data to and from your upstream services. 
                    
                    Kong Gateway has a library of plugins that support the most widely used methods of API gateway authentication.
                    
                    Common authentication methods include:

                    - Key Authentication
                    - Basic Authentication
                    - OAuth 2.0 Authentication
                    - LDAP Authentication Advanced
                    - OpenID Connect

          - type: structured_text
            config:
              header:
                text: "Why is authentication important?"
              blocks:
                - type: text
                  text: |
                    With Kong Gateway controlling authentication, requests wonâ€™t reach upstream services unless the client has successfully authenticated. This means upstream services process pre-authorized requests, freeing them from the cost of authentication, which is a savings in compute time and development effort.

                    Kong Gateway has visibility into all authentication attempts, which provides the ability to build monitoring and alerting capabilities supporting service availability and compliance.

Rather than attaching a configuration directly to a Service or Route, you create a KongPlugin definition and then annotate your Kubernetes resource with the konghq.com/plugins annotation.
