                    Authentication is the process of verifying that a requester has permissions to access a resource. 
                    As its name implies, API gateway authentication authenticates the flow of data to and from your upstream services. 
                    
                    Kong Gateway has a library of plugins that support the most widely used methods of API gateway authentication.

                    Basic authentication is a simple authentication method that uses a base64-encoded username and password combination as token.

                    Key authentication generates an API key for a consumer, which can be passed in an `apikey` header to access services and routes.

                    With Kong Gateway controlling authentication, requests wonâ€™t reach upstream services unless the client has successfully authenticated. This means upstream services process pre-authorized requests, freeing them from the cost of authentication, which is a savings in compute time and development effort.

                    Kong Gateway has visibility into all authentication attempts, which provides the ability to build monitoring and alerting capabilities supporting service availability and compliance.
