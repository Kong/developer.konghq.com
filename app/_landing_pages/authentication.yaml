                  Authentication is the process of verifying that a requester has permissions to access a resource. 
                  As its name implies, API gateway authentication controls the flow of data between clients and the gateway.
                  
                  With Kong Gateway controlling authentication, requests won’t reach upstream services unless the client has successfully authenticated. 
                  This means upstream services process pre-authorized requests, freeing them from the cost of authentication, which 
                  is a savings in compute time and development effort.

                  Kong Gateway has a library of plugins that support the most widely used methods of API gateway authentication.

                  Basic authentication is a simple authentication method that uses a base64-encoded username and password combination as token.

                  Key authentication generates an API key for a consumer, which can be passed in an `apikey` header to access services and routes.

                  OAuth 2.0 is a protocol that relies on an application to authorize access to services and routes.

                  OpenID Connect (OICD) is an authentication protocol based on OAuth 2.0. It works with identity providers to verify a user's identity without storing credentials.

                  With Kong Gateway controlling authentication, requests won’t reach upstream services unless the client has successfully authenticated. This means upstream services process pre-authorized requests, freeing them from the cost of authentication, which is a savings in compute time and development effort.

                  Kong Gateway has visibility into all authentication attempts, which provides the ability to build monitoring and alerting capabilities supporting service availability and compliance.

              KIC relies on Kong Gateway's Plugins, but configuring them with Kong Ingress Controller is different. 
              
              Rather than attaching a configuration directly to a service or route, you create a KongPlugin definition and then annotate your 
              Kubernetes resource with the `konghq.com/plugins` annotation.
