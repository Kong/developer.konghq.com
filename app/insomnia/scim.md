  - q: Do SCIM tokens expire?
    a: |
      Yes. SCIM tokens can expire. However, Insomnia automatically attempts to refresh the token every 90 days. If the automatic refresh fails, Insomnia warns the account owner and co-owners by email starting 20 days before the token expires. They also see warnings on the [SCIM](https://app.insomnia.rest/app/enterprise/scim) view. 
      
      To fix an automatic token refresh failure, go to [SCIM](https://app.insomnia.rest/app/enterprise/scim), and click **Refresh Token**. Then, in the **Passphrase** field, enter your passphrase, and click **Refresh Token** again. This manually refreshes your SCIM connector token.

System for Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM) allows Insomnia to provision Enterprise member accounts and teams using an Identity Provider configured for [Single Sign-On](/insomnia/sso/). 
With SCIM, you can manage users, teams, and licenses directly from your IdP. 

{:.info}
> Once you've enabled SCIM on your account, existing Insomnia users will be matched with users in your IdP based on their email address. If an Insomnia user doesn't exist in the IdP, they can still be managed individually in Insomnia, they won't lose access.

## Configure SCIM

To configure SCIM, you need to:
1. Add and verify a [domain](https://app.insomnia.rest/app/enterprise/domains/list).
1. Enable [SSO](https://app.insomnia.rest/app/enterprise/sso/list) for your Identity Provider.
1. Enable [SCIM](https://app.insomnia.rest/app/enterprise/scim) and generate a connector URL and token.
1. Configure your IdP for SCIM using the URL and token generated by Insomnia.

For a detailed how-to guide, see [Configure SCIM for Insomnia with Okta](/how-to/configure-scim-for-insomnia-with-okta/).

{:.warning}
> New users provisioned through SCIM will receive an email containing an initial passphrase needed to log in to Insomnia. If they don't have this passphrase, they can reset it.
