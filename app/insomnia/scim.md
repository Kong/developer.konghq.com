System for Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM) allows Insomnia to provision Enterprise member accounts and teams using an Identity Provider configured for [Single Sign-On](/insomnia/sso/). 
With SCIM, you can manage users, teams, and licenses directly from your IdP. 

{:.info}
> Once you've enabled SCIM on your account, existing Insomnia users will be matched with users in your IdP based on their email address. If an Insomnia user doesn't exist in the IdP, they can still be managed individually in Insomnia, they won't lose access.

## Configure SCIM

To configure SCIM, you need to:
1. Add and verify a [domain](https://app.insomnia.rest/app/enterprise/domains/list).
1. Enable [SSO](https://app.insomnia.rest/app/enterprise/sso/list) for your Identity Provider.
1. Enable [SCIM](https://app.insomnia.rest/app/enterprise/scim) and generate a connector URL and token.
1. Configure your IdP for SCIM using the URL and token generated by Insomnia.
