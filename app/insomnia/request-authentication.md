## What is request authentication in Insomnia?

Request authentication allows you to configure different authentication types and parameters to send with requests. This allows you to authenticate when you send a request.

## Why would I want to authenticate with requests in Insomnia?

Some requests require authentication to send. 

## Which authentication types are supported?

| Authentication type | Description |
|---------------------|-------------|
| [Basic auth](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7617.html) | Allows you to authenticate with a username and password |
| Digest auth | Allows you to authenticate with a username and password, but the client must send two requests instead of one. The first request sent to the server receives a nonce value, which is then used to produce a one-time-use hash key to authenticate the request.  |
