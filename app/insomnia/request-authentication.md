  - q: What should I do if I see SSL certificate errors in Insomnia?
    a: |
      If you encounter errors like:
      ```
      Error: unable to verify the first certificate
      ```
      or
      ```
      Error: Hostname/IP doesn't match certificate's altnames
      ```
      This likely means you're using an invalid or self-signed certificate, which is a common issue with local development servers.

      To bypass this, go to **Settings** and disable the **Validate SSL Certificates** option.

Some requests require authentication to ensure that the client requests access data securely. In Insomnia, you can configure different authentication types and parameters when you send a request so that it can authenticate. 

The Insomnia UI provides a simplified configuration for request authentication. It pre-populates the parameters when you select an auth type so you only have to fill in the values. 

## How do I configure authentication in my requests in Insomnia? 

Navigate to a request in a collection, click the **Auth** tab below your request, and select an authentication type from the dropdown menu.

## How does request authentication work?

Request authentication requires the client to validate their identity in some way before they can access the resources from the server.

The following diagram shows how [basic auth](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7617.html) works when it's required as part of request authentication:
