The location of your stored data depends on which storage option you're using:
* **Cloud sync:** Data is stored in Postgres databases in the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) us-central1 region.
* **Git sync:** Data is stored in the underlying storage for the source code management system and is not under Insomniaâ€™s control.
