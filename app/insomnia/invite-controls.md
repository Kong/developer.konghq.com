## Invite control for enterprise accounts

Enterprise owners can manage who is allowed to be invited to their organizations and projects using the Invite Control feature. This capability restricts invites based on email domains, helping prevent unauthorized or mistaken invitations.

Admins can choose from the following invite domain options:

- **All domains**: No restrictions on email domains.
- **Only verified domains**: Only previously verified domains are allowed.
- **Custom domains**: Specific domains defined per organization.

Invite Control can also disable the ability to invite users entirely. If any current members or pending invites do not comply with the configured domain rules, they can be identified and removed.

This feature supports enterprise-grade governance by ensuring only authorized individuals can access your organizations, alongside tools like [Storage Control](/insomnia/storage-control).
