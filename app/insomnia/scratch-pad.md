Local vault (scratch pad) is a storage option that allows all project data to be stored locally on your device. This option is ideal for users who prefer or require their data to remain off the cloud for privacy or security reasons.

Key features:
* **Local storage:** All project files are stored on your local machine.
* **No cloud interaction:** No data is sent to or stored in the cloud.
* **Security:** Enhanced security as data remains within your local environment.
* **Work offline:** Access and work on your projects without needing an internet connection.

Before you log in to Insomnia, you can use scratch pad by clicking **Use the local Scratch Pad** at the bottom of the log in screen.
