faqs:
  - q: Can I deactivate AI features in Insomnia?
    a: |
      Yes. To turn off AI features in the app:

      1. Click **Preferences**.
      2. Click the **AI Settings** tab.
      3. Deactivate the toggles for **Auto-generate Mock Servers from natural language** and **Suggest comments and grouping for Commits**.

      To stop using an LLM entirely, click **Deactivate** in **AI Settings**.  
  - q: Why can't I see any AI features?
    a: |
      You must configure and activate an LLM in **Preferences → AI Settings**.  
      If AI is deactivated at the instance level, the toggles remain unavailable in the UI.
  - q: How do I deactivate a LLM?
    a: |
      1. Click **Preferences**.
      2. Click the **AI Settings** tab.
      3. From the LLM type you want to deactivate, click **Deactivate**.

      Once deactivated, the Insomnia AI feature toggles are deactivated until a new LLM is configured.
  - q: How do I manage the AI features across my Organization?
    a: |
      1. In **Insomnia Admin**, open the **AI Settings** page.
      2. In **AI Features**, turn the following features **on** or **off** at the instance level:
         - **Auto-generate Mock Servers from natural language**
         - **Suggest comments and grouping for Commits**
      3. Save your changes.
      
      - **Defaults:** Features are activated by default for **Essentials** and **Pro** plans, and deactivated by default for **Enterprise** plans.
      - **Effect on users:** When deactivated at the instance level, AI-supported features do not appear in the main app UI and the toggles in **Preferences → AI Settings** display an error explaination.
      - **User setup still required:** Even when activated at the instance level, each user must **activate a model** in **Preferences → AI Settings** before they can turn on feature toggles.

Insomnia includes AI features that help you generate mock servers from natural language and improve Git commit hygiene. AI in Insomnia is powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) that you activate in **Preferences → AI Settings**. 

Choose from four provider types: 
- Local LLM
- Claude
- OpenAI
- Gemini

> As of Insomnia v12, AI features are currently free to use however, this may change in the future.

## AI features

Insomnia includes two AI-powered features:

{% table %}
columns:
  - title: Feature
    key: feature
  - title: Description
    key: description
  - title: Product context
    key: context
rows:
  - feature: "Auto-generate Mock Servers from natural language"
    description: "Creates a mock server from a prompt. Supports URL, OpenAPI, or text inputs."
    context: "Available when creating **Self-hosted** mock servers. For more information about mock servers, go to [**Mock servers**](/insomnia/mock-servers/)."
  - feature: "Suggest comments and grouping for Commits"
    description: "Analyzes staged Git changes to recommend logical commit groups and draft commit messages."
    context: "Available in the **Git Sync** interface."
{% endtable %}

## Configure AI in the app

Activate features by choosing and uploading an LLM in **Preferences → AI Settings**.

1. Click **Preferences**.  
2. Click the **AI Settings** tab.  
3. In the provider list, choose a LLM type: 
    - **Local LLM**: In the **Model** dropdown, click **Select a model**, and then choose a model.
    - **Claude**: Insert API key, and click **Load Models**.
    - **OpenAI**: Insert API key, and click **Load Models**.
    - **Gemini**: Insert API key, and click **Load Models**.    
4. Click **Activate**.

{:.decorative}
> **Tip**: For Local type LLM, add `.gguf` model files to your **LLMs** folder, and then select the **Refresh** icon to re-scan and make them available in the **Model** list.

Once an LLM is successfully uploaded to Insomnia, the feature toggles **Auto-generate Mock Servers from natural language** and **Suggest comments and grouping for Commits** are now activated and can be turned on or off as required.

## Use AI to auto-generate a mock server

Use Insomnia’s AI-assisted mock generation to take a short description, or an existing API source, and create a working **self-hosted mock**. Instead of hand-building dozens of endpoints, Insomnia scaffolds routes, example responses, and base configuration to help you prototype faster and unblock teams.

Generate a mock server from one of the following:
- **URL**: Generate from a live endpoint response.  
- **OpenAPI**: Generate from a spec.  
- **Text**: Generate from a natural-language prompt. 

### Create an autogenerated mock server

{:.warning}
> AI-generated mock servers only support **Self-hosted** hosting. Cloud hosting is not currently available for AI-generated mocks.

1. In your Insomnia project, click **Create**.  
2. Click **Mock Server**.  
3. Click **Auto-Generate**.  
4. Click **URL**, or **OpenAPI spec**, or **Text**. 
5. (Optional) Select the **Enable dynamic responses** checkbox.  
6. (Optional) Click **+ Add Files** to upload extra JSON files or YAML files.
7. Type an example URL.
8. Click **Create**.

To validate the action, open the **Mock Tester** tab, send a request, and confirm that the response matches the generated routes and fields.

## Use AI to suggest Git commit messages

Insomnia can suggest commit messages and grouping for staged changes in **Git Sync**. For Git concepts and workflows, go to [**Version control in Insomnia**](insomnia/version-control/).

### Suggest commit messages

1. Open the **Git Sync** interface.  
2. Click the **Suggest comments and grouping for Commits** button.  
3. Review the suggested commit groups and messages.  
4. (Optional) To edit a message inline, Double-click it.  
5. Drag and drop files between commit groups, or exclude files.  
6. Click **Commit** or **Commit & Push**.

Insomnia applies your final groups and messages with no additional AI runs after you save.

## Telemetry

The following events may be emitted by the app to reflect enablement changes:

- `ai_feature_enabled`  
- `ai_feature_disabled`

Both events can include metadata for feature name and enablement level (user or instance).
