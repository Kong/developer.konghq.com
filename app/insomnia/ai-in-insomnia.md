faqs:
  - q: Can I deactivate AI features for myself in Insomnia?
    a: |
      Yes. To turn off AI features in the application:

      1. Click **Preferences**.
      2. Click the **AI Settings** tab.
      3. Deactivate the toggles for **Auto-generate Mock Servers from natural language** and **Suggest comments and grouping for Commits**.

      To stop using an LLM entirely, click **Deactivate** in **AI Settings**.  
  - q: Why can't I see any AI features?
    a: |
      You must configure and activate an LLM in **Preferences → AI Settings**.  
      If AI is deactivated at the instance level, the toggles remain unavailable in the UI.
  - q: How do I deactivate a LLM?
    a: |
      1. Click **Preferences**.
      2. Click the **AI Settings** tab.
      3. From the LLM type you want to deactivate, click **Deactivate**.

      Once deactivated, the Insomnia AI feature toggles are deactivated until a new LLM is configured.
  - q: How do I manage the AI features across my organization?
    a: |
      1. In **Insomnia Admin**, open the **AI Settings** page.
      2. In **AI Features**, turn the following features **on** or **off** at the instance level:
         - **Auto-generate Mock Servers from natural language**
         - **Suggest comments and grouping for Commits**
      3. Save your changes.
      
      - **Defaults:** Features are activated by default for **Essentials** and **Pro** plans, and deactivated by default for **Enterprise** plans.
      - **Effect on users:** When deactivated at the instance level, AI-supported features do not appear in the main app UI and the toggles in **Preferences → AI Settings** display an error explanation.
      - **User setup still required:** Even when activated at the instance level, each user must **activate a model** in **Preferences → AI Settings** before they can turn on feature toggles.

> As of Insomnia v12, AI features are currently free to use however, this may change in the future.

Insomnia includes AI features that help you generate mock servers from natural language and improve Git commit hygiene. AI in Insomnia is powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) that you activate in **Preferences → AI Settings**. 

Choose from four provider types: 
- Local LLM
- Claude
- OpenAI
- Gemini

If you use a local LLM, it keeps all code and data on the your machine and allows complete control over where data is processed. However, local models may perform slower and generate less refined results than hosted models.

Different models can produce variable outputs for the same input. Results depend on the provider, model version, and prompt context. Insomnia does not guarantee deterministic or identical results across models. You must evaluate model behavior and review all generated content before use.

## AI features

Insomnia includes two AI-powered features:

{% table %}
columns:
  - title: Feature
    key: feature
  - title: Description
    key: description
  - title: Product context
    key: context
rows:
  - feature: "Auto-generate Mock Servers from natural language"
    description: "Creates a mock server from a prompt. Supports URL, OpenAPI, or text inputs."
    context: "Available when creating **Self-hosted** mock servers. For more information about mock servers, go to [**Mock servers**](/insomnia/mock-servers/)."
  - feature: "Suggest comments and grouping for Commits"
    description: "Analyzes staged Git changes to recommend logical commit groups and draft commit messages."
    context: "Available in the **Git Sync** interface."
{% endtable %}

## Configure AI in the app

Activate features by choosing and uploading an LLM in **Preferences → AI Settings**.

1. Click **Preferences**.  
2. Click the **AI Settings** tab.  
3. In the provider list, choose a LLM type: 
    - **Local LLM**: In the **Model** dropdown, click **Select a model**, and then choose a model.
    - **Claude**: Insert API key, and click **Load Models**.
    - **OpenAI**: Insert API key, and click **Load Models**.
    - **Gemini**: Insert API key, and click **Load Models**.    
4. Click **Activate**.

{:.decorative}
> **Tip**: For Local type LLM, add `.gguf` model files to your **LLMs** folder, and then select the **Refresh** icon to re-scan and make them available in the **Model** list.

Once a LLM is successfully uploaded to Insomnia, the toggles for the **Auto-generate Mock Servers from natural language** toggle and the **Suggest comments and grouping for Commits** toggle are now activated and can be turned on or off as required.

## Use AI to auto-generate a mock server

Use Insomnia’s AI-assisted mock server generation to transform a short description, or an existing API source into a working **self-hosted mock server**. Instead of hand-building dozens of endpoints, Insomnia scaffolds routes, example responses, and base configuration to help you prototype faster and unblock teams.

Generate a mock server from one of the following:
- **URL**: Generate from a live endpoint response.  
- **OpenAPI**: Generate from a spec.  
- **Text**: Generate from a natural-language prompt. 

### Create an autogenerated mock server

{:.warning}
> AI-generated mock servers only support **Self-hosted** hosting. Cloud hosting is currently unavailable for AI-generated mock servers.

1. In your Insomnia project, click **Create**.  
2. Click **Mock Server**.  
3. Click **Auto-Generate**.  
4. Click **URL**, or **OpenAPI spec**, or **Text**. 
5. (Optional) Select the [**Enable dynamic responses**](/insomnia/dynamic-mocking/) checkbox.  
6. (Optional) Click **+ Add Files** to upload extra JSON files or YAML files.
7. Type an example URL.
8. Click **Create**.

To validate the action, open the **Mock Tester** tab, send a request, and confirm that the response matches the generated routes and fields.

## Use AI to suggest Git commit messages

Insomnia can suggest commit messages and grouping for staged changes in **Git Sync**. For Git concepts and workflows, go to [**Version control in Insomnia**](insomnia/version-control/).

### Suggest commit messages

1. Open the **Git Sync** interface.  
2. Click **Suggest comments and grouping for Commits**.  
3. Review the suggested commit groups and messages.  
4. (Optional) To edit a message inline, double-click the message.  
5. Drag and drop files between commit groups, or exclude files.  
6. Click **Commit** or **Commit & Push**.

Insomnia applies your final groups and messages with no additional AI runs after you save.
