## Allowlist

For enterprise users utilizing Insomnia, it's crucial to ensure that specific domains are allowlisted in your network. This step is essential to guarantee that all features of Insomnia, including updates, synchronization, and documentation, work without any hindrance in environments with restricted internet access.

Allowlisting these domains ensures uninterrupted access to all functionalities of Insomnia, including updates, documentation, and necessary backend services. Should you experience issues post-allowlisting, we recommend seeking assistance from your IT support or reaching out to Insomnia's customer service at `<support@insomnia.rest> ` or 
 the [Kong support website](https://support.konghq.com/support/s/).

## Proxy

In version 10.1 and later, Insomnia automatically detects the operating system proxy settings. However, you can still customize proxy settings from **Preferences** > **Proxy**.

{:.warning}
> **Important**: Proxy server settings apply to all traffic going through the Insomnia application, and cannot be restricted to entities such as collections and individual requests.

Here's an example usage of HTTP or HTTPS proxy:

```bash
http://localhost:8005
```

For SOCKS4 or SOCKS5 proxy, one of the following prefixes should be used before the hostname, depending on the version: `socks4://`, `socks4a://`, `socks5://`, `socks5h://`

```bash
socks5h://localhost:8005
```

You can also add a comma-separated list of hostnames to the **No Proxy** box and they will be exempt from going through the proxy server.

### Proxy server authentication

Insomnia supports proxy server authentication via Basic Auth, digest, and NTLM.

If your proxy server requires Basic Auth, you can include the credentials in the URL like the following:

```bash
http://username:password@localhost:8005
```
