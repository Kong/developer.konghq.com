## Teams

You can use teams to manage access for multiple users.

Teams are managed in [**Enterprise Controls** > **Teams**](https://app.insomnia.moe/app/enterprise/team). 
You can create new teams, invite users to teams, and assign organizations to teams.

{:.info}
> Roles are defined on the team level, which means that if the same team is linked to multiple organizations, the team members will have the same role in all linked organizations.
