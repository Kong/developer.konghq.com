## How do I create requests in Insomnia?

In Insomnia, requests are contained in collections. Before you can create a request, you need to create a collection. To do that, click **Create** > **Request collection** in your Insomnia project.

Once your collection is created, there are several ways to create requests. Click the `+` button and select an option:

|Create a request from scratch|Select the type or request to create (HTTP, Event Stream, GraphQL, gRPC, or WebSocket).|
|Import a cURL command|Select **From Curl**, then paste your command and click Import.|
|Import from a file (Postman collection, Swagger, OpenAPI, HAR, WSDL)|Click **From File**, select an import option (file, URL, or clipboard), specify the file to import, then click **Scan** and **Import**.|
