Insomnia Organizations allows Insomnia Users to share Collections and Environments safely and securely with their colleagues using Insomnia Cloud or Git sync for collaboration.
Members of an organization can make commits and set up branches for their collections. They can also view commits and branches from other members.

Insomnia Organization Admins have the ability to administer Role-Based Access Control, providing the ability to scope user access to Design Documents and Request Collections on an as-needed basis.

As Git Sync is also supported, User permissions may also be governed through Git source code management providers.
