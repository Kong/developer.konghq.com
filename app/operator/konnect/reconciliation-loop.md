faqs:
  - q: How often does the reconcile loop run?
    a: |
      New resources are created immediately using the Konnect API.

      Existing resources are processed once per minute by default. This is customizable, but we recommend keeping the default value so that you do not hit the Konnect API rate limit.

  - q: I deleted a resource in the UI, but it wasnâ€™t recreated by the operator. Why?
    a: Wait 60 seconds, then check the UI again. The reconcile loop only runs once per minute.

{{site.operator_product_name}} watches for changes in the Kubernetes cluster and synchronizes them against {{site.konnect_short_name}}.

The synchronization is performed in a loop, where the operator reconciles the state of the cluster with the state of {{site.konnect_short_name}}.

Changes made in your Kubernetes cluster are synced with {{ site.konnect_short_name }} immediately. Any changes made outside of the cluster (using the UI, for example) will be overwritten within 60 seconds.

## How it works

The algorithm is as follows:

- When a Kubernetes resource is created:
  - The operator checks if it has references and whether they are valid, if not it assigns a failure condition to the resource.
  - If the resource has references and they are valid, the operator calls the Konnect API's create method.
    - If the creation was unsuccessful, the operator assigns a failure condition to the resource.
    - If the creation was successful, the operator assigns the resource's ID, OrgID, ServerURL and status conditions.
  - The operator enqueues the resource for update after the configured sync period passes.

- When a Kubernetes resource is updated:
  - The operator checks if the resource's spec, annotations or labels have changed.
  - If the spec, annotations or labels have changed:
    - The operator calls the Konnect API's update method.
      - If the update was unsuccessful, the operator assigns a failure condition to the resource.
      - If the update was successful, the operator waits for the configured sync period to pass.
  - If the spec, annotations or labels have not changed:
    - If sync period has not passed, the operator enqueues the resource for update.
    - If sync period has passed, the operator calls the Konnect API's update method.
      - If the update was unsuccessful, the operator assigns a failure condition to the resource.
      - If the update was successful, the operator enqueues the resource for update.

- When a Kubernetes resource is deleted:
  - The operator calls the Konnect API's delete method.
    - If the deletion was unsuccessful, the operator assigns a failure condition to the resource.
    - If the deletion was successful, the operator removes the resource from the cluster.
