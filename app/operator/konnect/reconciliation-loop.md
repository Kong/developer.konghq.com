faqs:
  - q: How often does the reconcile loop run?
    a: |
      New resources are created immediately using the {{ site.konnect_short_name }} API.

      Existing resources are processed once per minute by default. This is customizable, but we recommend keeping the default value so that you do not hit the {{ site.konnect_short_name }} API rate limit.

  - q: I deleted a resource in the UI, but it wasnâ€™t recreated by the operator. Why?
    a: The reconciliation loop runs every 60 seconds. Wait one minute, then refresh the UI to see the resource restored.

{{site.gateway_operator_product_name}} continuously watches your Kubernetes cluster and reconciles its state with {{site.konnect_short_name}}.

This happens in a loop where the operator detects changes in the cluster and synchronizes them to {{site.konnect_short_name}}. Changes made in the Kubernetes cluster are propagated immediately. Changes made outside the cluster are overwritten within 60 seconds.

## How it works

The reconciliation loop follows these steps:


* On Kubernetes resource creation:
  - The operator checks if it has references and whether they are valid, if not it assigns a failure condition to the resource.
  - If the resource has references and they are valid, the operator calls the {{ site.konnect_short_name }} API's create method.
    - If the creation was unsuccessful, the operator assigns a failure condition to the resource.
    - If the creation was successful, the operator assigns the resource's `ID`, `OrgID`, `ServerURL` and status conditions.
  - The operator enqueues the resource for update after the configured sync period passes.

- When a Kubernetes resource is updated:
  - The operator checks if the resource's spec, annotations or labels have changed.
  - If the spec, annotations or labels have changed:
    - The operator calls the {{ site.konnect_short_name }} API's update method.
      - If the update was unsuccessful, the operator assigns a failure condition to the resource.
      - If the update was successful, the operator waits for the configured sync period to pass.
  - If the spec, annotations or labels have not changed:
    - If sync period has not passed, the operator enqueues the resource for update.
    - If sync period has passed, the operator calls the {{ site.konnect_short_name }} API's update method.
      - If the update was unsuccessful, the operator assigns a failure condition to the resource.
      - If the update was successful, the operator enqueues the resource for update.

- When a Kubernetes resource is deleted:
  - The operator calls the {{ site.konnect_short_name }} API's delete method.
    - If the deletion was unsuccessful, the operator assigns a failure condition to the resource.
    - If the deletion was successful, the operator removes the resource from the cluster.
