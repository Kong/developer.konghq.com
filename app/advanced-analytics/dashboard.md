This is still placeholder text


Data ingestion is managed from the **Control Plane Dashboard** using the analytics toggle. 
This feature allows you to enable or disable data collection for your API traffic per control plane.

**Modes:**
- **On:** Both basic and advanced analytics data is collected, allowing in-depth insights and reporting.
- **Off:** Advanced analytics collection stops, but basic API metrics remain available in Gateway Manager.

**Note:** If analytics is disabled, new data will not appear in [Custom Reports](/advanced-analytics/reports/) 
or [API Requests](/api/konnect/analytics-requests/v2/), but basic usage stats will still be accessible.


You can assign users to predefined **Analytics teams** in {{site.konnect_short_name}} to control access levels. 
This allows specific users to **view** or **manage** Analytics independently.

Learn more in the [Teams Reference](/konnect-platform/teams-and-roles/).
