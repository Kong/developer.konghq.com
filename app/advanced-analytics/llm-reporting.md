  - q: What can I do after customizing an Explorer dashboard?
    a: |
        * **Save as a Report**: This function creates a new custom report based on your current view, allowing you to revisit these specific insights at a later time.
        * **Export as CSV**: If you prefer to analyze your data using other tools, you can download the current view as a CSV file, making it portable and ready for further analysis elsewhere.

Advanced Analytics allows you to monitor and optimize your LLM usage by providing detailed insights into objects such as token consumption, costs, and latency. 

With LLM usage reporting, you can:

* Track token consumption: Monitor the number of tokens processed by the different LLM models you have configured. 
* Understand costs: Gain visibility into the costs associated with your LLM providers. 
* Measure latency: Analyze the latency involved in processing LLM requests. 

To use this feature, navigate to the [Explorer dashboard](https://cloud.konghq.com/us/analytics/explorer) and switch between API usage and LLM usage using the dataset dropdown. Metrics and groupings will dynamically adjust based on the selected dataset. 

## Metrics

Traffic metrics provide insight into which of your services are being used and how they are responding. Within a single report, you have the flexibility to choose one or multiple metrics from the same category.
