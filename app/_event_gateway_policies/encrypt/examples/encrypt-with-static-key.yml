description: Encrypt a message value using a static key.

extended_description: |
  Encrypt a message value using a static key.

  The key must be a secret reference to a 128-bit (16-byte) base64-encoded string, or the key itself as a string.
  We recommend using secret references to avoid exposing sensitive data in your configuration.
