title: Encrypt using a static key

description: Encrypt a message value using a static key.

extended_description: |
  Encrypt a message value using a static key.

  The [static key](/event-gateway/entities/static-key/) must be a secret reference to a 256-bit (32-byte) base64-encoded string, or the key itself as a string.
  We recommend using secret references to avoid exposing sensitive data in your configuration.
