title: Encrypt using a static key

description: Encrypt portions of a message using a list of static keys.

extended_description: |
  Encrypt portions of a message using a list of static keys.

  The key must be a secret reference to a 128-bit (16-byte) base64-encoded string, or the key itself as a string.
  We recommend using secret references to avoid exposing sensitive data in your configuration.

 - "A corresponding [Decrypt policy](/event-gateway/policies/decrypt/examples/decrypt-with-static-key/). Event Gateway uses the key ID from the Encrypt policy along with the actual key in the Decrypt policy to successfully decrypt."
 
variables:
  key1_value:
    description: A custom value for the static key `static://key-1` that will be used for encrypting the `value` of the Kafka records.
    value: $KEY1_VALUE
  key2_value:
    description: A custom value for the static key `static://key-2` that will be used for encrypting the `key` of the Kafka records.
    value: $KEY2_VALUE
