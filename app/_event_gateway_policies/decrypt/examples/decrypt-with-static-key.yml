title: Decrypt using a static key

description: Decrypt a message value using a static key.


extended_description: |
  Decrypt a message value using a static key.

  The [static key](/event-gateway/entities/static-key/) must be a secret reference to a 256-bit (32-byte) base64-encoded string, or the key itself as a string.
  We recommend using secret references to avoid exposing sensitive data in your configuration.

requirements:
 - "A [static key](/event-gateway/entities/static-key/)."
 - "A corresponding [Encrypt policy](/event-gateway/policies/encrypt/examples/encrypt-with-static-key/) that uses the static key.
   Event Gateway uses the key reference in the message payload set by the Encrypt policy and looks for the actual key in `key_sources` to successfully decrypt."
