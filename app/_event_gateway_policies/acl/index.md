The ACL (Access Control List) policy manages authorization for your [virtual cluster](/event-gateway/entities/virtual-cluster/) by defining which actions authenticated principals can perform on specific resources.

By default, when ACLs are enabled, principals have no access. You must explicitly define access rules through ACL policies.

## Use cases

Common use cases for the ACLs policy:

  - use_case: "[Allow consumer group management](./examples/manage-consumer-groups/)"
    description: Allow the authenticated principal to create and delete consumer groups.

## How it works

This policy runs in the [cluster phase](/event-gateway/entities/policy/#phases).

1. A Kafka client produces a message and sends it to {{site.event_gateway_short}}.
1. {{site.event_gateway_short}} checks the client's action against the configured ACL.
  * If the action is allowed, it passes the message onward.
  * If the action isn't allowed, the message is dropped.
