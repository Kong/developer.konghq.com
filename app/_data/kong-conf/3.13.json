It may also\nreduce the latency jitter if the Kong proxy node's latency to the main\nPostgres instance is high.\n\nThe read-only Postgres instance only serves read queries, and write\nqueries still go to the main connection. The read-only Postgres instance\ncan be eventually consistent while replicating changes from the main\ninstance.\n\nAt least the `pg_ro_host` config is needed to enable this feature.\nBy default, all other database config for the read-only connection is\ninherited from the corresponding main connection config described above but\nmay be optionally overwritten explicitly using the `pg_ro_*` config below.\n"

So it will first try\nthe entire `SEARCH` list for the `SRV` type, if that fails it will try the\n`SEARCH` list for `A`, etc.\n\nFor the duration of the `ttl`, the internal DNS resolver will load balance each\nrequest it gets over the entries in the DNS record. For `SRV` records, the\n`weight` fields will be honored, but it will only use the lowest `priority`\nfield entries in the record.\n\nFor DNS records returned with a TTL value of 0, Kong will default to caching\nthese records for 1 second. Strict adherence to the requirement of not caching\nTTL 0 records could generate excessive query frequency to upstream DNS servers,\nleading to unsustainable load and potential service degradation. As a result,\nmost DNS resolver implementations deviate from this requirement in practice.\n"

This is\n        similar to the behavior in\n        Kong Gateway prior to 2.3.0.\n\nThe default `sandbox` environment does not\nallow importing other modules or libraries,\nor executing anything at the OS level (for\nexample, file read/write). The global\nenvironment is also not accessible.\n\nExamples of `untrusted_lua = sandbox`\nbehavior:\n\n- You can't access or change global values\n  such as `kong.configuration.pg_password`\n- You can run harmless Lua:\n  `local foo = 1 + 1`. However, OS level\n  functions are not allowed, like:\n  `os.execute(`rm -rf /*`)`.\n\nTo customize the sandbox environment, use\nthe `untrusted_lua_sandbox_requires` and\n`untrusted_lua_sandbox_environment`\nparameters below.\n",
