A Service Catalog scorecard helps you evaluate services based on validation criteria. Scorecards help you detect issues, like whether there are services in the catalog that don't have an on-call engineer assigned or if you have GitHub repositories with stale pull requests that aren't getting reviewed or closed. From the scorecard view, you can view details on either a per-service or per-criteria basis.

## Scorecard templates
