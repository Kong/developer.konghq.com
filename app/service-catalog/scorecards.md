A {{site.konnect_catalog}} scorecard helps you evaluate services based on validation criteria. Scorecards help you detect issues, like whether there are services in the catalog that don't have an on-call engineer assigned, or if you have GitHub repositories with stale pull requests that aren't getting reviewed or closed. 

From the scorecard view, you can view details on either a per-service or per-criteria basis.
