The GitHub integration allows you to associate your Service Catalog service to one or more GitHub repositories.

For each linked repository, the UI can show a **Repository Summary** with simple data pulled from the GitHub API, such as the number of open issues, open pull requests, most recently closed pull requests, languages, and more.
{% include /service-catalog/multi-resource.md %}
## Authorize the GitHub integration

1. From the **Service Catalog** in {{site.konnect_short_name}}, select **[Integrations](https://cloud.konghq.com/us/service-catalog/integrations)**. 
2. Select **GitHub**, then **Add GitHub Instance**.
3. Select **Authorize**. 

This will take you to GitHub, where you can grant {{site.konnect_short_name}} access to either **All Repositories** or **Select repositories**. 

The {{site.konnect_short_name}} application can be managed from GitHub as a [GitHub Application](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/using-github-apps/authorizing-github-apps).
