  q: How can I govern my MCP traffic using Kong AI Gateway?
  a: |
    Use Kong’s AI Proxy Advanced plugin to load balance MCP requests across multiple OpenAI models, and secure the traffic with the AI Prompt Guard plugin. The guard plugin filters prompts based on allow and deny patterns, ensuring only safe, relevant requests reach your GitHub MCP server, while blocking potentially harmful or unauthorized commands.

## Reconfigure the AI Proxy Advanced Plugin

This configuration uses the AI Proxy Advanced plugin to load balance requests between OpenAI’s `gpt-4` and `gpt-4o` models using a round-robin algorithm. Both models are configured to call a GitHub-hosted remote MCP server via the `llm/v1/responses` route. The plugin injects the required OpenAI API key for authentication and logs both payloads and statistics. With equal weights assigned to each target, traffic is split evenly between the two models.

{:.info}
> This configuration is for demonstration purposes only and is not intended for production use.

{% entity_examples %}

  plugins:
    - name: ai-proxy-advanced
      config:
        balancer:
          algorithm: round-robin

{% endentity_examples %}

## Validate MCP Traffic balancing

After configuring the `ai-proxy-advanced` plugin with round-robin load balancing, you can verify that traffic is distributed across both OpenAI models. This script sends 10 test requests to the MCP server route and prints the model used in each response. If load balancing is working correctly, the output should alternate between `gpt-4` and `gpt-4o` based on their configured weights.

```bash
for i in {1..10}; do
  echo -n "Request #$i — Model: "
  curl -s -X POST "http://localhost:8000/anything/v1/responses" \
    -H "Accept: application/json" \
    -H "apikey: hello_world" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    --json "{
      \"tools\": [
        {
          \"type\": \"mcp\",
          \"server_label\": \"gitmcp\",
          \"server_url\": \"https://api.githubcopilot.com/mcp/x/repos\",
          \"require_approval\": \"never\",
          \"headers\": {
            \"Authorization\": \"Bearer $GITHUB_PAT\"
          }
        }
      ],
      \"input\": \"tools available with github mcp\"
    }" | jq -r '.model'
  sleep 3
done
```

If successful, the script should give the following output:

```text
Request #1 — Model: gpt-4o-2024-08-06
Request #2 — Model: gpt-4-0613
Request #3 — Model: gpt-4o-2024-08-06
Request #4 — Model: gpt-4-0613
Request #5 — Model: gpt-4o-2024-08-06
Request #6 — Model: gpt-4o-2024-08-06
Request #7 — Model: gpt-4o-2024-08-06
Request #8 — Model: gpt-4o-2024-08-06
Request #9 — Model: gpt-4o-2024-08-06
Request #10 — Model: gpt-4-0613
```

## Configure the AI Prompt Guard plugin

In this step, we secure our MCP traffic even further by adding the AI Prompt Guard plugin. This plugin enforces content-level filtering using allow and deny patterns. It ensures only safe, relevant prompts reach the model—for example, questions about GitHub MCP capabilities—while blocking potentially harmful or abusive inputs like exploit attempts or security threats.

  plugins:
    - name: ai-prompt-guard
      config:
        allow_patterns:
          - "(?i).*GitHub MCP.*"
          - "(?i).*MCP server.*"
          - "(?i).*(tools?|features?|capabilities?|options?) available.*"

          - "(?i).*(auth(entication)?|token|scan|quality|security|setup).*"
        deny_patterns:
          - ".*(hacking|hijacking|exploit|bypass|malware|backdoor|ddos|phishing|payload|sql injection).*"
          - ".*(root access|unauthorized|breach|exfiltrate|data leak|ransomware).*"
          - ".*(zero[- ]day|CVE-\\\\d{4}-\\\\d+|buffer overflow).*"

## Enforce local rate limiting

Now you can enforce local rate limiting by configuring the AI Rate Limiting Advanced plugin to enforce strict rate limits on requests to the OpenAI provider. This uses a local strategy with a fixed window of 10 seconds, which only allows one request per 10-second window. Requests exceeding this limit within the same window will receive a `429 Too Many Requests` response, effectively controlling request bursts and protecting backend resources.

{:.info}
> **Note:** This configuration is for showcase and testing purposes only. In a production environment, rate limits and window sizes should be adjusted to match actual usage patterns and performance requirements.


{% entity_examples %}
entities:
    plugins:
    - name: ai-rate-limiting-advanced
      config:
        strategy: local
        window_type: fixed
        llm_providers:
        - name: openai
        window_size:
        - 10
        limit:
        - 1
{% endentity_examples %}


## Validate rate limiting

We can test our simple rate limiting configuration by running the following script:

```bash
for i in {1..6}; do
  echo -n "Request #$i — Status: "
  http_status=$(curl -s -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code}' -X POST "http://localhost:8000/anything/v1/responses" \
    -H "Accept: application/json" \
    -H "apikey: hello_world" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    --json "{
      \"tools\": [
        {
          \"type\": \"mcp\",
          \"server_label\": \"gitmcp\",
          \"server_url\": \"https://api.githubcopilot.com/mcp/x/repos\",
          \"require_approval\": \"never\",
          \"headers\": {
            \"Authorization\": \"Bearer $GITHUB_PAT\"
          }
        }
      ],
      \"input\": \"tools available with github mcp\"
    }")
  echo "$http_status"

  if [[ $i == 3 ]]; then
    sleep 10
  else
    sleep 1
  fi
done
```

Which should give the following output:

```text
Request #1 — Status: 200
Request #2 — Status: 200
Request #3 — Status: 429
Request #4 — Status: 200
Request #5 — Status: 429
Request #6 — Status: 429
```
{:. no-copy-code  }

Our rate limit configuration is allowing 2 requests per 60 seconds, which means that:

- Requests #1 and #2 are allowed (status `200`).

- Request #3 exceeds the limit (status `429`).

- After sleeping 10 seconds, the window partially resets.

- Request #4 falls into a new window and gets allowed (status `200`).

- Requests #5 and #6 again exceed the limit (status `429`).
