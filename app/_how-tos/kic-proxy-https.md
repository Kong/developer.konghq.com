  q: How do I route HTTPS traffic with {{ site.kic_product_name }}?
  a: Create an `HTTPRoute` or `Ingress` resource, which will then be converted into a [{{ site.base_gateway }} Service](/gateway/entities/service/) and [Route](/gateway/entities/route/). Specify a Kubernetes Secret containing a TLS certificate to terminate HTTPS requests using {{ site.base_gateway }}.

## Generate a TLS certificate

{% include /k8s/create-certificate.md namespace='kong' hostname='demo.example.com' cert_required=true %}

## Route HTTPs traffic

To listen for HTTPS traffic, configure an additional TLS listener on your `Gateway` resource:

```bash
kubectl patch -n kong --type=json gateway kong -p='[
    {
        "op":"add",
        "path":"/spec/listeners/-",
        "value":{
            "name": "https",
            "port": 443,
            "protocol":"HTTPS",
            "hostname":"demo.example.com",
            "allowedRoutes": {
              "namespaces": {
                "from": "All"
              }
            },
            "tls": {
              "mode": "Terminate",
              "certificateRefs":[{
                "group":"",
                "kind":"Secret",
                "name":"demo.example.com"
              }]
            }
        }
    }
]'
```

## Create an HTTPRoute

To route HTTP traffic, you need to create an `HTTPRoute` or an `Ingress` resource pointing at your Kubernetes `Service`.

{% include /k8s/httproute.md release=page.release path='/echo' name='echo' service='echo' port='1027' hostname='demo.example.com' section_name='https' %}

## Validate your configuration

Once the resource has been reconciled, you'll be able to call the `/echo` endpoint and {{ site.base_gateway }} will route the request to the `echo` service.


{% validation request-check %}
url: /echo
insecure: true
headers:
  - "Host: demo.example.com"
status_code: 200
on_prem_url: $PROXY_IP
konnect_url: $PROXY_IP
{% endvalidation %}
