## Create add the file ruleset

In the Git repository connected to your document, create a `.spectral.yaml` at the same directory as the OAS file to lint.

## Define the rules

The custom ruleset overrides the default one. If you want to create a completely new ruleset, you can simply add your rules in the file using the [Spectral](https://docs.stoplight.io/docs/spectral/e5b9616d6d50c-rulesets) syntax. If you want to extend an existing ruleset, specify the ruleset with the `extend` property in `.spectral.yaml`.

For example, if you want to extend the default [Spectral OpenAPI](https://docs.stoplight.io/docs/spectral/4dec24461f3af-open-api-rules) ruleset to add a warning when tags don't have a description, you can add the following content to `.spectral.yaml`:

```yaml
extends: spectral:oas
rules:
  tag-description:
    description: Tags must have a description.
    given: $.tags[*]
    severity: warn
    then:
      field: description
      function: truthy
```

## Synchronize the changes

Commit and push the file on the repository, then pull the changes in Insomnia.  

{:.info}
> This will place the `.spectral.yaml` file in the local working directory.  You will not see the file in the Insomnia UI but the linting rules will be applied to the associated OAS file.

## Validate

Close and reopen the document to apply the changes. In this example, you can validate by creating a new tag without a description:
```yaml
tags:
  - name: flight-data
```

This causes a new warning to appear:
