## Add filter

Custom Dashboards support dashboard-level filters that apply across all tiles in a dashboard. Filters help users narrow down the data shown in charts without modifying individual tiles.

1. To add a preset to an existing dashboard, select the [Dashboard](https://cloud.konghq.com/us/analytics/dashboards) section and navigate to an existing dashboard.

1. From the dashboard, select an existing tile and choose **edit**. 

1. From the **Edit tile** modal you can use the **Add filter** option to select from a list of filters. 


## Configure the filter

You can select from an existing filter and configure the options, in this case select the following: 

* Filter by: **Control plane**
* Operator: **In**
* Filter value: **default**

This will create a filter scoped to the default control plane. Click **Save** to save the configuration


## Validate

You can validate the filter is working succesfully by looking at the tile in your [Dashboard](https://cloud.konghq.com/us/analytics/dashboards).
The tile will now display information about your control plane.
