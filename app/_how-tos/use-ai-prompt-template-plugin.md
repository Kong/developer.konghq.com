## Configure the AI Proxy plugin

Start by configuring the AI Proxy plugin to route prompts to Mistral AI.

{% entity_examples %}
entities:
  plugins:
    - name: ai-proxy
      config:
        route_type: llm/v1/chat
        auth:
          header_name: Authorization
          header_value: Bearer ${key}
        model:
          provider: mistral
          name: mistral-tiny
          options:
            mistral_format: openai
            upstream_url: https://api.mistral.ai/v1/chat/completions

variables:
  key:
    value: $MISTRAL_API_KEY

## Configure the AI Prompt Template plugin

Now, we can configure the AI Prompt Template plugin with predefined, reusable prompt templates for common tasks. The plugin will automatically [block all untemplated requests](/how-to/use-ai-prompt-template-plugin/#denied-prompts) via `allow_untemplated_requests: false` setting.

This configuration defines five prompt templates:

{% table %}
columns:
  - title: Template name
    key: name
  - title: Description
    key: description
rows:
  - name: summarizer
    description: Summarizes long text into concise bullet points.
  - name: code-explainer
    description: Explains source code in beginner-friendly terms.
  - name: email-drafter
    description: Drafts professional emails based on topic and recipient.
  - name: product-describer
    description: Generates marketing descriptions from product details and features.
  - name: qna
    description: Answers user questions clearly and factually.
{% endtable %}

    text: "Of all human sciences the most useful and most imperfect appears to me to be that of mankind: and I will venture to say, the single inscription on the Temple of Delphi contained a precept more difficult and more important than is to be found in all the huge volumes that moralists have ever written. I consider the subject of the following discourse as one of the most interesting questions philosophy can propose, and unhappily for us, one of the most thorny that philosophers can have to solve. For how shall we know the source of inequality between men, if we do not begin by knowing mankind? And how shall man hope to see himself as nature made him, across all the changes which the succession of place and time must have produced in his original constitution? How can he distinguish what is fundamental in his nature from the changes and additions which his circumstances and the advances he has made have introduced to modify his primitive condition? Like the statue of Glaucus, which was so disfigured by time, seas and tempests, that it looked more like a wild beast than a god, the human soul, altered in society by a thousand causes perpetually recurring, by the acquisition of a multitude of truths and errors, by the changes happening to the constitution of the body, and by the continual jarring of the passions, has, so to speak, changed in appearance, so as to be hardly recognisable. Instead of a being, acting constantly from fixed and invariable principles, instead of that celestial and majestic simplicity, impressed on it by its divine Author, we find in it only the frightful contrast of passion mistaking itself for reason, and of understanding grown delirious."
