        Once you are done experimenting with StatsD, you can use the following
        command to stop the StatsD server you created in this guide:

        ```sh
        docker stop kong-quickstart-statsd
        ```

## Start a StatsD server

Use the following command to run a StatsD container to capture monitoring data:

```sh
docker run -d --rm -p 8126:8126 \
  --name kong-quickstart-statsd --network=kong-quickstart-net \
  statsd/statsd:latest
```

## Enable the StatsD plugin

Configure the StatsD plugin with the hostname and port of the listening StatsD service. In this example, the listening host is the Docker container name, since it was started in the same network as the {{site.base_gateway}} quickstart, and the port is `8125`:

{% entity_examples %}
entities:
  plugins:
    - name: statsd
      config:
        host: kong-quickstart-statsd
        port: 8125
{% endentity_examples %}

## Validate

You can validate that the plugin is collecting metrics by generating traffic to the example Service:
<!--vale off -->
{% validation request-check %}
url: '/anything'
status_code: 200
display_headers: true
{% endvalidation %}
<!--vale on -->

Run this command to check the metrics collected with StatsD:
```
echo "counters" | nc localhost 8126
```
In the response from StatsD, you should see a request count, the response code received, and a few other metrics. 
In this case, the request to the `/anything` path should have generated:
```
  'kong.service.example-service.request.count': 1,
  'kong.service.example-service.status.200': 1,
  ...
```
