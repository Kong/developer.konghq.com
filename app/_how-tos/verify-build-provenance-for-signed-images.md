tldr:
    q: How do I verify {{site.ee_product_name}} Docker build provenance?
    a: |
      {{site.base_gateway}} Docker container images are signed using [`cosign`](https://github.com/sigstore/cosign), with signatures published to the Docker Hub repository `kong/notary`.

      Because Kong uses Github Actions to build and release, Kong also uses Githubâ€™s OIDC identity to sign images.
      You can verify these signatures using the `cosign verify` command.
