## Create a service in {{site.konnect_catalog}}

In this tutorial, you'll map Gateway Services from Gateway Manager to a service in {{site.konnect_catalog}}. Because the Gateway Manager integration is built-in, you don't need to install or authorize it like other {{site.konnect_catalog}} integrations. 

Create a service that you'll map to your Gateway Manager resources:

<!--vale off-->
{% konnect_api_request %}
url: /v1/catalog-services
method: POST
status_code: 201
region: us
body:
  name: billing
  display_name: Billing Service
{% endkonnect_api_request %}
<!--vale on-->

Export the {{site.konnect_catalog}} service ID:

```sh
export SERVICE_ID='YOUR-SERVICE-ID'
```

## List Gateway Manager resources

Before you can map a resource to {{site.konnect_catalog}}, you first need to find the resources that are pulled in from Gateway Manager:

<!--vale off-->
{% konnect_api_request %}
url: /v1/resources?filter%5Bintegration.name%5D=gateway-manager
method: GET
region: us
status_code: 200
{% endkonnect_api_request %}
<!--vale on-->

Export the resource ID you want to map to the service:

```sh
export GATEWAY_MANAGER_RESOURCE_ID='YOUR-RESOURCE-ID'
```

## Map resources to a {{site.konnect_catalog}} service

Now, you can map the Gateway Manager resource to the service:

<!--vale off-->
{% konnect_api_request %}
url: /v1/resource-mappings
method: POST
status_code: 201
region: us
body:
  service: $SERVICE_ID
  resource: $GATEWAY_MANAGER_RESOURCE_ID
{% endkonnect_api_request %}
<!--vale on-->


## Validate the mapping

To confirm that the Gateway Manager resource is now mapped to the intended service, list the serviceâ€™s mapped resources:

<!--vale off-->
{% konnect_api_request %}
url: /v1/catalog-services/$SERVICE_ID/resources
method: GET
status_code: 200
region: global
{% endkonnect_api_request %}
<!--vale on-->
