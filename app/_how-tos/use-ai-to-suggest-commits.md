## Use AI to Suggest Commits

To speed up Git workflows and maintain clean history, Insomnia can suggest how to group and comment your Git commits using AI.

### Generate Commit Suggestions

1. In the **Commit to Git** dialog, click **Suggest AI Commits**.
2. Insomnia analyzes file changes and displays grouped commit sets with recommended messages.
3. **Review** each commit group:
   - To edit inline, double-click the message.
   - To reorganize, drag and drop files between groups.
   - To skip certain files, use the **Excluded Files** box.
4. Click **Commit**.

> **Tip:** You can switch back to manual mode at any time. Your previous manual changes are preserved.

### Disable AI Suggestions

You can turn off commit suggestions by deactivating AI features in **Preferences** or through your organization's policy.
