## Set environment variables

Set the {{site.base_gateway}} license as a variable:
```sh
export KONG_LICENSE_DATA='LICENSE-CONTENTS-GO-HERE'
```

## Start {{site.base_gateway}}

Create the {{site.base_gateway}} container and enable RBAC and basic auth. In this example, we can use the quickstart:
```bash
curl -Ls get.konghq.com/quickstart | bash -s -- -e "KONG_LICENSE_DATA" \
    -e "KONG_ENFORCE_RBAC=on" \
    -e "KONG_ADMIN_GUI_AUTH=basic-auth" \
    -e "KONG_PASSWORD=kong" \
    -e 'KONG_ADMIN_GUI_SESSION_CONF={"secret":"kong"}'
```

This enables RBAC, sets `basic-auth` as the authentication method, and creates a session secret.

Kong Manager uses the [Session](/plugins/session/) plugin in the background.
This plugin (configured with `admin_gui_session_conf`) requires a secret and is configured securely by default. Under all circumstances, the `secret` must be manually set to a string.

For more information about the values, see the [RBAC](/gateway/entities/rbac/) reference.

## Validate

To validate that basic authentication was configured correctly for Kong Manager, navigate to the Kong Manager GUI at [http://localhost:8002](http://localhost:8002) and use the username (`kong_admin`) and the password (`kong`) you set when you created the {{site.base_gateway}} container.

{:.warning}
> To log in to Kong Manage with basic auth, you must have [super admin permissions](/how-to/create-a-super-admin/) or a user that has `/admins` and `/rbac` read and write access.
