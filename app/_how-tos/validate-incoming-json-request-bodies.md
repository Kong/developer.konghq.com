faqs:
  - q: How can I enable a JSON threat protection policy without blocking non-conforming requests? 
    a: |
      You can enable the JSON Threat Protection plugin in tap mode by setting `config.enforcement_mode` to `log_only`.
      In tap mode, the plugin still inspects the JSON body but only logs warnings instead of blocking violations, and still proxies the request to the upstream service.

## Create a JSON threat protection policy

Configure the JSON Threat Protection plugin on the `example-route` Route to set limits on the contents of incoming request bodies.

In the following example, we enable the plugin in `block` mode, which will reject any requests that don't conform to the policy, 
and instead respond with a `400` error and the message `Incorrect request format`:

{% entity_examples %}
entities:
  plugins:
    - name: json-threat-protection
      route: example-route
      config:
        max_body_size: 1024
        max_container_depth: 2
        max_object_entry_count: 4
        max_object_entry_name_length: 7
        max_array_element_count: 2
        max_string_value_length: 6
        enforcement_mode: block
        error_status_code: 400
        error_message: "Incorrect request format"
{% endentity_examples %}

## Validate the policy

Let's make a valid request. The following request conforms to the policy that we just created:

{% validation request-check %}
url: '/anything'
headers:
  - "Content-Type: application/json"
body:
  name: Jason
  age: 20
  gender: male
  parents:
   - Joseph
   - Viva
method: POST
status_code: 200
display_headers: true
{% endvalidation %}

You should get a `200` response, and the request gets proxied to the upstream service.

Now, try a request with a payload that doesn't conform to the policy:

{% validation request-check %}
url: '/anything'
headers:
  - "Content-Type: application/json"
body:
  name: Jason
  age: 20
  gender: male
  parents:
   - Antonio
   - Viva
method: POST
status_code: 400
display_headers: true
{% endvalidation %}

In this case, the string `Antonio` is longer than the maximum allowed string length of 6, so the request is blocked.
The plugin returns a `400` response and the message `Incorrect request format`.
