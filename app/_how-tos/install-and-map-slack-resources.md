        You must be a Slack admin to authorize the integration. Both **read** and **write** scopes are required by {{site.konnect_short_name}} to complete the connection.

## Authorize the Slack integration

1. From the **Service Catalog** in {{site.konnect_short_name}}, click **[Integrations](https://cloud.konghq.com/us/service-catalog/integrations)**.
2. Click **Slack**, then click **Add Slack instance**.
3. Name your integration `slack` and authorize the Slack instance. Slack will prompt you to grant read and write permissions to {{site.konnect_short_name}}. Only Slack administrators can authorize the integration.

Once authorized, resources from your Slack account will be discoverable in the UI.


## Create a service in Service Catalog

Create a service that you'll map to your Slack resources:

<!--vale off-->
{% konnect_api_request %}
url: /v1/catalog-services
method: POST
status_code: 201
region: us
body:
  name: billing
  display_name: Billing Service
{% endkonnect_api_request %}
<!--vale on-->

Export the service ID:

```sh
export SLACK_SERVICE_ID='YOUR-SERVICE-ID'
```

## List Slack resources

Before you can map your Slack resources to a service in Service Catalog, you first need to find the resources that are pulled in from Slack:

<!--vale off-->
{% konnect_api_request %}
url: /v1/resources?filter%5Bintegration.name%5D=slack
method: GET
region: us
status_code: 200
{% endkonnect_api_request %}
<!--vale on-->

{:.info}
> You might need to manually sync your Slack integration for resources to appear. From the {{site.konnect_short_name}} UI by navigating to the Slack integration you just installed and selecting **Sync Now** from the **Actions** dropdown menu.

Export the resource ID you want to map to the service:

```sh
export SLACK_RESOURCE_ID='YOUR-RESOURCE-ID'
```

## Map resources to a service

Now, you can map the Slack resource to the service:

<!--vale off-->
{% konnect_api_request %}
url: /v1/resource-mappings
method: POST
status_code: 201
region: us
body:
  service: billing
  resource: $SLACK_RESOURCE_ID
{% endkonnect_api_request %}
<!--vale on-->


## Validate the mapping

To confirm that the Slack resource is now mapped to the intended service, list the serviceâ€™s mapped resources:

<!--vale off-->
{% konnect_api_request %}
url: /v1/catalog-services/$SLACK_SERVICE_ID/resources
method: GET
status_code: 200
region: us
{% endkonnect_api_request %}
<!--vale on-->
