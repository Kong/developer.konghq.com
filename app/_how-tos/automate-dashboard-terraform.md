  q: How do I automate dashboard creation using Terraform?
  a: |
    Use the `konnect_dashboard` resource from the [terraform](/terraform/) provider to define and manage dashboards.
    You can import existing dashboards or create new ones with configurable chart layouts, titles, and filters.

## Get the dashboard ID

In this tutorial, we'll export an existing dashboard in {{site.konnect_short_name}} and modify it with Terraform, so you can integrate {{site.konnect_short_name}} Analytics with your existing workflow.

Managing dashboards with Terraform requires the dashboard ID of the target dashboard:

1. Get an existing dashboard ID from the {{site.konnect_short_name}} URL of your dashboard. It appears at the end of the URL when viewing the dashboard in the UI:
   ```
   https://cloud.konghq.com/us/analytics/dashboards/$DASHBOARD_ID
   ```

1. Export the dashboard ID into an environment variable to be used later: 

  ```
  export DASHBOARD_ID='fe1b6b51-2e7e-44d6-bfa5-CC93489b3eed'
  ```
## Import the dashboard

Now configure Terraform to import a dashboard from {{site.konnect_short_name}}.

```hcl
echo '
import {
  provider = "konnect-beta"
  to = konnect_dashboard.service_dashboard_template
  id = "8e66b804-a060-466a-aa6c-145e7f696228"
}
' >> import.tf
```
Be sure to replace the `id` with the `id` you exported for your dashboard.
## Generate the Terraform configuration


1. Initialize Terraform:
    ```sh
    terraform init
    ```
1. Generate the Terraform configuration for the dashboard: 
    ```sh
    terraform plan -generate-config-out=create_dashboard.tf
    ```


This creates a new file named `create_dashboard.tf` that contains the Terraform resource definition for the imported dashboard.


## Configure the dashboard

The new `create_dashboard.tf` file contains information about your dashboard. You can use this file to make changes to the dashboard in {{site.konnect_short_name}} with Terraform: 

```sh

          }
          layout = {
            position = {
              col = 4
              row = 6
            }
            size = {
              cols = 2
              rows = 2
            }
          }
          type = "chart"
        }
      },
    ]
  }
  labels = null
  name   = "Quick summary dashboard"
}
```
{:.no-copy-code}

You can add a label to the dashboard by modifying the file to replace `labels = null` with the following: 

```
  labels = {
    test = "test"
  }
```

## Validate

To validate that your changes are working, make an update in the generated Terraform file (for example, change a chart label).

1. Run the following command to apply the update:
   ```sh
   terraform apply -auto-approve
   ```
1. After the change is applied, return to the [{{site.konnect_short_name}} dashboard manager](https://cloud.konghq.com/us/analytics/dashboards) to confirm the "test" label has been added to the dashboard.
