You can create a fully configured mock server in Insomnia using a natural language description. Powered by AI, this feature generates routes, sample responses, and mock configuration from your prompt.

{:.info}
> When you auto-generate a mock server with AI, Insomnia supports only the **Self-hosted** hosting option. Cloud Mock is  currently unavailable for AI-generated mock servers. 

## Create an autogenerated self-hosted mock server

1. In your Insomnia project, click **Create**.
2. Click **Mock Server**.
3. Click **Auto-Generate**.
3. From the **Input type** dropdown menu, select a source format.
  - URL
  - OpenAPI spec
  - JSON file
4. In the prompt box, enter a description of the mock server.  
   Example: `My API is for products. I want to be able to create, update, delete, get, and list products. Products should have a name, a price, and a quantity.` 
5. If you require dynamic content on your mock server, select the **Enable dynamic responses** checkbox.
6. (Optional) To add additional files to your prompt, click **+ Add Files**.
7. Click **Create**.

The mock server opens and is then ready for testing and editing.

## Validate and test your mock server

After the mock server is created:

- To send requests and inspect responses, use the **Mock Tester** tab.
- Confirm that the generated endpoints and responses match your expectations.
- Edit the mock server configuration as needed.
