    q: How do you associate a Certificate with an SNI and make sure it works?
    a: |
      After creating a Certificate entity in {{site.base_gateway}}, 
      you can associate it to an SNI and use `openssl` to verify that {{site.base_gateway}} returns the expected certificate for the SNI.

      content: |
        Set the `SNI_NAME` as an environment variable. 
        This is the name of the [SNI](/gateway/entities/sni/) that you intend to associate the Certificate to.

        For example: 
        ```sh
        export SNI_NAME=my.sni.example.com
        ```

## Associate your certificate with an SNI

Associate the Certificate you created as a [prerequisite](#prerequisites) with an SNI. 
If the SNI doesn't exist, this request creates a new one:

{% control_plane_request %}
url: certificates/$CERT_ID/snis
method: POST
headers:
  - 'Accept: application/json'
  - 'Content-Type: application/json'
body:
  name: $SNI_NAME
{% endcontrol_plane_request %}

## Validate the certificate

Using `openssl`, open a connection with {{site.base_gateway}} and check that {{site.base_gateway}} returns the correct certificate for the SNI:

```sh
echo "" | openssl s_client \
  -connect 127.0.0.1 \
  -port 8443 \
  -servername $SNI_NAME 2>/dev/null \
  | openssl x509 -text -noout | head -10
```

The response will contain the certificate you created and attached to the SNI in the first step, along with the `CN` and any other information you used when creating the certificate. 
Because TLS passthrough is not enabled, {{site.base_gateway}} is returning its own Certificate. 

For instructions on configuring TLS passthrough, review the how-to guide on [Proxying TLS traffic](/how-to/proxy-tls-passthrough-traffic-using-sni/).
