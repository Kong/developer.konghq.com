## Enable rate limiting

Enable the [Rate Limiting plugin](/plugins/rate-limiting/) for the Service. 
In this example, the limit is 5 requests per minute and 1000 requests per hour.

{% entity_examples %}
entities:
  plugins:
    - name: rate-limiting
      service: example-service
      config:
        minute: 5
        hour: 1000
{% endentity_examples %}

## Validate

After configuring the Rate Limiting plugin, you can verify that it was configured correctly and is working, by sending more requests than allowed in the configured time limit.

{% validation rate-limit-check %}
iterations: 6
url: '/anything'
{% endvalidation %}
