    q: How can I access HashiCorp Vaults secrets in {{site.base_gateway}}? 
    a: |
      [Install and run HashiCorp Vault](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/tutorials/get-started/install-binary#install-vault) in dev mode or self-managed. [Write a secret to the Vault](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/tutorials/secrets-management/versioned-kv?variants=vault-deploy%3Aselfhosted#write-secrets) like `vault kv put secret/customer/acme name="ACME Inc."`. Save your HashiCorp Vault token, host, port, protocol, and KV secrets engine version and use them to configure a {{site.base_gateway}} [Vault entity](/gateway/entities/vault/). Use `{vault://hashicorp-vault/customer/acme/name}` to reference the secret in any referenceable field.

faqs:
  - q: How do I rotate my secrets in HashiCorp Vault and how does {{site.base_gateway}} pick up the new secret values?
    a: You can rotate your secret in HashiCorp Vault by creating a new secret version with the updated value. You'll also want to configure the `ttl` settings in your {{site.base_gateway}} Vault entity so that {{site.base_gateway}} pulls the rotated secret periodically.
  - q: How does {{site.base_gateway}} retrieve secrets from HashiCorp Vault?
    a: |
      {{site.base_gateway}} retrieves secrets from HashiCorp Vault's HTTP API through a two-step process: authentication and secret retrieval.

      **Step 1: Authentication**

      Depending on the authentication method defined in `config.auth_method`, {{site.base_gateway}} authenticates to HashiCorp Vault using one of the following methods:

      - If you're using the `token` auth method, {{site.base_gateway}} uses the `config.token` as the client token.
      - If you're using the `kubernetes` auth method, {{site.base_gateway}} uses the service account JWT token mounted in the pod (path defined in the `config.kube_api_token_file`) to call the login API for the Kubernetes auth path on the HashiCorp Vault server and retrieve a client token.
      - {% new_in 3.4 %} If you're using the `approle` auth method, {{site.base_gateway}} uses the AppRole credentials to retrieve a client token. The AppRole role ID is configured by field `config.approle_role_id`, and the secret ID is configured by field `config.approle_secret_id` or `config.approle_secret_id_file`. 
        - If you set `config.approle_response_wrapping` to `true`, then the secret ID configured by
        `config.approle_secret_id` or `config.approle_secret_id_file` will be a response wrapping token, 
        and {{site.base_gateway}} will call the unwrap API `/v1/sys/wrapping/unwrap` to unwrap the response wrapping token to fetch 
        the real secret ID. {{site.base_gateway}} will use the AppRole role ID and secret ID to call the login API for the AppRole auth path
        on the HashiCorp Vault server and retrieve a client token.
      
      By calling the login API, {{site.base_gateway}} will retrieve a client token and then use it in the next step as the value of `X-Vault-Token` header to retrieve a secret.

      **Step 2: Retrieving the secret**

      {{site.base_gateway}} uses the client token retrieved in the authentication step to call the Read Secret API and retrieve the secret value. The request varies depending on the secrets engine version you're using.
      {{site.base_gateway}} will parse the response of the read secret API automatically and return the secret value.

## Create a secret in HashiCorp Vault

Write a secret to HashiCorp Vault:
```
vault kv put secret/customer/acme name="ACME Inc."
```

## Create decK environment variables 

We'll use decK environment variables for the `host` and `token` in the {{site.base_gateway}} Vault configuration. This is because these values typically vary between environments. 

In this tutorial, we're using `host.docker.internal` as our host instead of the `localhost` variable that HashiCorp Vault is using. This is because if you used the quick-start script {{site.base_gateway}} is running in a container and uses a different `localhost`.

Because we are running HashiCorp Vault in dev mode, we are using `root` for our `token` value. 

```
export DECK_HCV_HOST=host.docker.internal
export DECK_HCV_TOKEN='root'
```


## Create a Vault entity for HashiCorp Vault 

Using decK, create a Vault entity in the `kong.yaml` file with the required parameters for HashiCorp Vault:

{% entity_examples %}
entities:
  vaults:
    - name: hcv
      prefix: hashicorp-vault
      description: Storing secrets in HashiCorp Vault
      config:
        host: ${hcv_host}
        token: ${hcv_token}
        kv: v2
        mount: secret
        port: 8200
        protocol: http

variables:
  hcv_host:
    value: $HCV_HOST
  hcv_token:
    value: $HCV_TOKEN
{% endentity_examples %}

## Validate

Since {{site.konnect_short_name}} data plane container names can vary, set your container name as an environment variable:
{: data-deployment-topology="konnect" }
```sh
export KONNECT_DP_CONTAINER='your-dp-container-name'
```
{: data-deployment-topology="konnect" }

To validate that the secret was stored correctly in HashiCorp Vault, you can call a secret from your vault using the `kong vault get` command within the Data Plane container. 

{% validation vault-secret %}
secret: '{vault://hashicorp-vault/customer/acme/name}'
value: 'ACME Inc.'
{% endvalidation %}

If the vault was configured correctly, this command should return the value of the secret. You can use `{vault://hashicorp-vault/customer/acme/name}` to reference the secret in any referenceable field.
