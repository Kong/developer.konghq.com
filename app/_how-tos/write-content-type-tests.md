## Create a test suite

Before you create a test, you need to create a test suite for our collection. 

To do this, click the **Tests** tab and click **New test suite** in the sidebar.

## Create a top-level content type in body test

Now you can test if a content type is returned in the top-level request body. 

1. Click **New test** and enter a name for the test, such as "Content type in body (top-level)". 
1. From the **Select a request** drop down, select the **GET KongAir planned flights** request.
1. The following Javascript checks if the top-level array is present in the body of the response. Enter the following in the Javascript for your test:
```javascript
const response1 = await insomnia.send();
const body = JSON.parse(response1.data);
const item = body[1];
expect(item).to.be.an('object');
```
1. Click the **Play** icon next to your test. In the preview to the right, you should see that the test passes.

## Create a nested content type in body test

Now you can test if a content type is returned in the nested request body. 

1. Click **New test** and enter a name for the test, such as "Content type in body (nested)". 
1. From the **Select a request** drop down, select the **GET Fetch more details about a flight** request.
1. The following Javascript checks if the nested `meal_options` array is present in the body of the response. Enter the following in the Javascript for your test:
```javascript
const response1 = await insomnia.send();
const body = JSON.parse(response1.data);
expect(body).to.have.property('meal_options'); 
expect(body.meal_options).to.be.an('array');
expect(body).to.be.an('object'); 
```
1. Click the **Play** icon next to your test. In the preview to the right, you should see that the test passes.
