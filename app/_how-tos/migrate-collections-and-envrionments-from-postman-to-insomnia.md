      This how-to guide requires a Postman export. You can either export environments and collections individually (this can be useful if you want to import them into different Insomnia projects), or all at once from:
      * The [Postman export page](https://web.postman.co/me/export) if you a  re using Postman Enterprise or Cloud.
      * **Settings** > **Data** in your Postman app if you are using the scratch pad.

## Create a project in Insomnia

In Insomnia, click the **+** button in the left panel to create a new project in which you'll import your Postman data. Select your preferred project type, in this example, we'll use **Cloud Sync**.

## Import your Postman data

1. In the new project, click **Import** and select the files to import. You can import a ZIP file containing all of your Postman data, or separate JSON files.
1. Click **Scan** to get a list of all the data that will be imported into Insomnia:
   ![Import of Postman data with two collections and an environment](/assets/images/insomnia/postman-scan.png)
1. Click **Import**.

In this example, two collections and an environment are imported. In the case of a Cloud Sync project, the imported data is automatically synchronize. You don't need to do anything else to share it with other members in your organization.

## Select global environments (Optional)

If your collections use variables from a global environments, you'll need to click **Base Environment** and select the global environment in each collection.
