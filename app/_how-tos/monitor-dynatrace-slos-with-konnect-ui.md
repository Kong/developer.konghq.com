        You need to configure the following in Dynatrace SaaS:
        * A [classic service-level object in Dynatrace](https://docs.dynatrace.com/docs/deliver/service-level-objectives-classic/configure-and-monitor-slo). This will be ingested by {{site.konnect_short_name}}.
        * Your Dynatrace URL. For example: `https://whr42363.apps.dynatrace.com`
        * A [Dynatrace personal access token](https://docs.dynatrace.com/docs/manage/identity-access-management/access-tokens-and-oauth-clients/access-tokens/personal-access-token) with read SLO (`slo.read`) permissions.

## Configure the Dynatrace integration

Before you can discover APIs in {{site.konnect_catalog}}, you must configure the Dynatrace integration.

1. In the {{site.konnect_short_name}} sidebar, click **Catalog**.
1. In the Catalog sidebar, click **[Integrations](https://cloud.konghq.com/us/service-catalog/integrations)**. 
1. Click **Dynatrace**.
1. Click **Add Dynatrace instance**.
1. In the **Dynatrace API Base URL** field, enter your Dynatrace URL without the trailing `/`. For example: `https://whr42363.apps.dynatrace.com`
1. In the **Dynatrace API key** field, enter your Dynatrace personal access token.
1. In the **Display name** field, enter `Dynatrace`.
1. In the **Instance name** field, enter `dynatrace`.
1. Click **Save**.

## Create a {{site.konnect_catalog}} service and map the SLO resources

Now that your integration is configured, you can create a {{site.konnect_catalog}} service to map the ingested SLOs.

{:.info}
> In this tutorial, we'll refer to your ingested Dynatrace SLO as `billing-slo`.

1. In the {{site.konnect_short_name}} sidebar, click [**{{site.konnect_catalog}}**](https://cloud.konghq.com/service-catalog/).
1. In the Catalog sidebar, click **Services**.
1. Click **New service**.
1. In the **Display Name** field, enter `Billing Service`.
1. In the **Name** field, enter `billing-service`.
1. Click **Create**.
1. Click **Map Resources**.
1. Select `billing-slo`. 
1. Click **Map 1 Resource**.

Your integration SLOs are now discoverable from one {{site.konnect_catalog}} service.

{:.info}
> You might need to manually sync your Dynatrace integration for resources to appear. From the {{site.konnect_short_name}} UI by navigating to the Dynatrace integration you just installed and selecting **Sync Now** from the **Actions** dropdown menu.

## Validate the mapping

To confirm that the Dynatrace resource is now mapped to the intended service, navigate to the service:

1. In the {{site.konnect_short_name}} sidebar, click [**{{site.konnect_catalog}}**](https://cloud.konghq.com/service-catalog/).
1. In the {{site.konnect_catalog}} sidebar, click **Services**.
1. Click the **Billing Service** service.
1. Click the **Resources** tab.

You should see the `billing-slo` resource listed.
