## Enable the Key Authentication plugin on the Service:

Enable Key Auth for the Service.

{% entity_examples %}
entities:
  plugins:
    - name: key-auth
      service: example-service
      config:
        key_names:
        - apikey
{% endentity_examples %}

## Create a Consumer

[Consumers](/gateway/entities/consumer/) let you identify the client that's interacting with {{site.base_gateway}}.The Consumer needs an API key to access any {{site.base_gateway}} Services.

{% entity_examples %}
entities:
  consumers:
    - username: alex
      keyauth_credentials:
        - key: hello_world
{% endentity_examples %}

## Validate

After configuring the Key Authentication plugin, you can verify that it was configured correctly and is working, by sending requests with and without the API key you created for your Consumer.

This request should be successful:

{% validation request-check %}
url: /anything
headers:
  - 'apikey: hello_world'
{% endvalidation %}

This request includes an invalid API key:

{% validation unauthorized-check %}
url: /anything
headers:
  - 'apikey: another_key'
status_code: 400
{% endvalidation %}
