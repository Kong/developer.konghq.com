        Before testing with Insomnia, complete the [Aggregate MCP tools from multiple AI MCP Proxy plugins](/mcp/aggregate-mcp-tools/) guide.  
        That guide produces:

        - Multiple conversion-only AI MCP Proxy plugin instances that each expose MCP tools  
        - One listener-mode AI MCP Proxy plugin aggregating those tools by tag  
        - A public listener endpoint:
          ```
          http://localhost:8000/mcp-listener
          ```

        Ensure your local machine can reach the listener endpoint produced during aggregation.

        Test connectivity:
        ```
        curl http://localhost:8000/mcp-listener
        ```

  q: How do I test aggregated MCP tools using Insomnia?

    Connect an Insomnia MCP client to the listener-mode AI MCP Proxy endpoint that the aggregation setup creates. Then test each tool and validate behaviour using Insomnia’s Params, Headers, Events, and Console panels.

Use Insomnia to connect to an MCP server exposed through the AI MCP Proxy plugin in listener mode. 

This listener server aggregates MCP tools from multiple upstream APIs, enabling you to validate end-to-end behaviour using Insomnia’s Params, Headers, Events, and Console panels.

After completing the aggregation workflow described in **[Aggregate MCP tools from multiple AI MCP Proxy plugins](/mcp/aggregate-mcp-tools/)** and exposing an autogenerated or aggregated MCP server, follow this guide to test and validate its MCP tools using Insomnia’s MCP Clients.

## Create an MCP client

1. Open **Insomnia**.
2. In the sidebar, click **MCP Clients**.
3. Click **New MCP Client**.
4. In the **Name** field, enter a name: **Aggregated MCP Tools**
5. In the **MCP Server URL** field, enter your listener URL: `http://localhost:8000/mcp-listener`
6. Click **Connect**.

Insomnia connects to the MCP server and discovers all of the aggregated tools.

## Validate tools

1. In the sidebar, locate the **Tools** drop-down section.
2. Review the list of available tools.

{:.info}
> If any tools are missing:
- Confirm that all conversion-only plugins use the same `tags[]` value.
- Confirm that the listener-mode plugin’s `server.tag` matches that value.
- Confirm that the listener Route is active and reachable.

## Test tools

Use Insomnia’s testing panels to validate MCP tool behaviour:

1. In **Tools**, click any tool.
2. In the request pane, click the **Params** tab.
3. Enter the required parameter value.
4. Click **Call Tool**.
5. In the response pane, click the **Console** tab. 

A successful response confirms that your aggregated MCP configuration is working correctly.
