    q: How do I scrape {{site.base_gateway}} metrics with Datadog and the Prometheus plugin?
    a: Install the Datadog Agent and enable the Prometheus plugin. Configure the Datadog Agent with the {{site.base_gateway}} `/metrics` endpoint and set `kong.*` for `metrics`. Restart the Datadog Agent, and send requests to generate metrics. You should see the metrics in Datadog Metrics summary.

        For this tutorial, you'll need to configure the following:
        * A [Datadog account](https://www.datadoghq.com/)
        * Install the Datadog Agent by navigating to the [Agent Installation](https://app.datadoghq.com/account/settings/agent/latest) page or **Integration** > **Install agents** in the Datadog UI.
        * Your Datadog [API key](https://docs.datadoghq.com/getting_started/site/) and [app key](https://app.datadoghq.com/access/application-keys). You can find these in the Datadog UI in **Organization settings**.

        Set the following as environment variables:
        ```sh
        export DD_API_KEY='YOUR-API-KEY'
        export DD_APP_KEY='YOUR-APPLICATION-KEY'
        export DD_SITE_API_URL='YOUR-API-SITE-URL'
        ```
        
        {:.warning}
        > * Some distributions require you to modify the `datadog.yaml` file and add your API key and Datadog site URL. Ensure this file is configured correctly or Datadog won't be able to scrape metrics.
        > * Your Datadog site API URL [varies depending on the region](https://docs.datadoghq.com/getting_started/site/) you're using. For example, for the `US5` region, the URL would be `https://api.us5.datadoghq.com`.

## Enable the Prometheus plugin

Before you configure the Datadog Agent to scrape metrics from {{site.base_gateway}}, you first need to enable the [Prometheus plugin](/plugins/prometheus/). 

The following configuration enables the plugin globally and [exports status code metrics](/plugins/prometheus/reference/#schema--config-status-code-metrics), like the total number of HTTP requests:

{% entity_examples %}
entities:
  plugins:
    - name: prometheus
      config:
        status_code_metrics: true
{% endentity_examples %}


## Configure the Datadog Agent to collect {{site.base_gateway}} metrics

Now that the Prometheus plugin is configured, you can configure the Datadog Agent to scrape {{site.base_gateway}} metrics.

macOS (others: https://docs.datadoghq.com/agent/configuration/agent-configuration-files/#agent-configuration-directory)

Create the `conf.yaml` file:

```sh
touch ./.datadog-agent/conf.d/openmetrics.d/conf.yaml
```

This command uses the macOS directory location. For other distributions, see Datadog's [Agent configuration directory](https://docs.datadoghq.com/agent/configuration/agent-configuration-files/#agent-configuration-directory). 

Copy and paste the following configuration in the `conf.yaml` file:

```yaml
instances:
  - openmetrics_endpoint: http://localhost:8001/metrics
    namespace: kong
    metrics:
      - kong.*
```
{: data-deployment-topology="on-prem" }

```yaml
instances:
  - openmetrics_endpoint: http://localhost:8100/metrics
    namespace: kong
    metrics:
      - kong.*
```
{: data-deployment-topology="konnect" }

This configuration pulls all the `kong.` prefixed metrics from the {{site.base_gateway}} metrics endpoint (`http://localhost:8001/metrics`).

## Restart the Datadog Agent

You must restart the agent to start collecting metrics:

```sh
launchctl stop com.datadoghq.agent
```
```sh
launchctl start com.datadoghq.agent
```

This example is for macOS, see Datadog's [Agent commands](https://docs.datadoghq.com/agent/configuration/agent-commands/#start-stop-and-restart-the-agent) documentation for all restart commands.

The Datadog Agent may take a few minutes to restart.

## Validate

Now, you can validate that Datadog can scrape {{site.base_gateway}} metrics by first sending requests to generate metrics:

{% validation request-check %}
url: '/anything' 
count: 10
status_code: 200
{% endvalidation %}

You can validate that {{site.base_gateway}} is sending metrics to Datadog by running the following:

```sh
curl -X GET "$DD_SITE_API_URL/api/v1/search?q=kong.kong_http_requests.count" \
-H "Accept: application/json" \
-H "DD-API-KEY: $DD_API_KEY" \
-H "DD-APPLICATION-KEY: $DD_APP_KEY"
```

You should get the following response:
```sh
{"results":{"metrics":["kong.kong_http_requests.count"],"hosts":[]}}
```
{:.no-copy-code}

Alternatively, you can navigate to the Metrics Explorer page in the Datadog UI and search for `kong.kong_http_requests.count`. You should see the 10 requests that you just sent.
