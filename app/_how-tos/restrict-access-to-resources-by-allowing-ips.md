## 1. Enable IP restriction

Enable the [IP Restriction plugin](/plugins/ip-restriction/) globally. 
In this example, we'll allow the reserved `192.0.2.0/24` IP range:

{% entity_examples %}
entities:
  plugins:
    - name: ip-restriction
      config:
        allow:
        - 192.0.2.0/24
{% endentity_examples %}

## 2. Validate

After configuring the IP Restriction plugin, you can verify that it was configured correctly and is working, by sending a request:

{% validation request-check %}
url: /anything
status_code: 403
{% endvalidation %}

You should get a `403 Forbidden` status with the message `IP address not allowed`.
