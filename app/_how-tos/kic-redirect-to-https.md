## Create a HTTPRoute

To route HTTP traffic, you need to create a `HTTPRoute` or an `Ingress` resource pointing at your Kubernetes `Service`.

{% include /k8s/httproute.md path='/echo' name='echo' service='echo' port='1027' skip_host=true %}

## Add TLS configuration

{% include /k8s/add-tls.md namespace='kong' hostname=demo_domain cert_required=true %}

## Configure a HTTPS redirect

Kong handles HTTPS redirects by automatically issuing redirects to requests whose characteristics match a HTTPS-only route except for the protocol. For example, with a Kong route such as this:

```json
{ "protocols": ["https"], "hosts": ["{{ demo_domain }}"],
  "https_redirect_status_code": 301, "paths": ["/echo/"], "name": "example" }
```

A request for `http://{{ demo_domain }}/echo/green` receives a 301 response with a `Location: https://{{ demo_domain }}/echo/green` header. Kubernetes resource annotations instruct the controller to create a route with `protocols=[https]` and `https_redirect_status_code` set to the code of your choice (the default if unset is `426`).

1. Configure the protocols that are allowed in the `konghq.com/protocols` annotation.
{% capture the_code %}
{% navtabs codeblock %}
{% navtab "Gateway API" %}
```bash
kubectl annotate -n kong httproute echo konghq.com/protocols=https
```
{% endnavtab %}
{% navtab "Ingress" %}

```bash
kubectl annotate -n kong ingress echo konghq.com/protocols=https
```
{% endnavtab %}
{% endnavtabs %}
{% endcapture %}
{{ the_code | indent: 4 }}

1. Configure the status code used to redirect in the `konghq.com/https-redirect-status-code` annotation.
   {% capture the_code %}
{% navtabs codeblock %}
{% navtab "Gateway API" %}

```bash
kubectl annotate -n kong httproute echo konghq.com/https-redirect-status-code="301"
```
{% endnavtab %}
{% navtab "Ingress" %}

```bash
kubectl annotate -n kong ingress echo konghq.com/https-redirect-status-code="301"
```
{% endnavtab %}
{% endnavtabs %}
{% endcapture %}
{{ the_code | indent: 4 }}

{:.info}
> **Note**: {{ site.kic_product_name }} _does not_ use a [HTTPRequestRedirectFilter](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/reference/spec/#gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1.HTTPRequestRedirectFilter) to configure the redirect. Using the filter to redirect HTTP to HTTPS requires a separate HTTPRoute to handle redirected HTTPS traffic, which does not align well with Kong's single route redirect model.
> 
> Work to support the standard filter-based configuration is ongoing. Until then, the annotations allow you to configure HTTPS-only HTTPRoutes.

## Validate your configuration

With the redirect configuration in place, HTTP requests now receive a redirect rather than being proxied upstream:
1. Send a HTTP request.
    ```bash
    curl -ksvo /dev/null http://{{ demo_domain }}/echo --resolve {{ demo_domain }}:80:$PROXY_IP 2>&1 | grep -i http
    ```

    The results should look like this:

    ```text
    > GET /echo HTTP/1.1
    < HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently
    < Location: https://{{ demo_domain }}/echo
    ```

1. Send a curl request to follow redirects using the `-L` flag navigates
to the HTTPS URL and receive a proxied response from upstream.

    ```bash
    curl -Lksv http://{{ demo_domain }}/echo --resolve {{ demo_domain }}:80:$PROXY_IP --resolve {{ demo_domain }}:443:$PROXY_IP 2>&1
    ```

    The results should look like this (some output removed for brevity):

    ```text
    > GET /echo HTTP/1.1
    > Host: {{ demo_domain }}
    >
    < HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently
    < Location: https://{{ demo_domain }}/echo
    < Server: kong/3.4.2
    
    * Issue another request to this URL: 'https://{{ demo_domain }}/echo'

    * Server certificate:
    *  subject: CN={{ demo_domain }}
     
    > GET /echo HTTP/2
    > Host: {{ demo_domain }}
    >
    < HTTP/2 200
    < via: kong/3.4.2
    <
    Welcome, you are connected to node kind-control-plane.
    Running on Pod echo-74d47cc5d9-pq2mw.

    ```

Kong correctly serves the request only on HTTPS protocol and redirects the user
if the HTTP protocol is used. The `-k` flag in cURL skips certificate
validation as the certificate served by Kong is a self-signed one. If you are
serving this traffic through a domain that you control and have configured TLS
properties for it, then the flag won't be necessary.
