tldr: 
  q: How do I apply multiple rate limits or window sizes with one plugin instance?
  a: |
    You can use the Rate Limiting Advanced plugin to apply any number of rate limits and window sizes per plugin instance. 
    This lets you create multiple rate limiting windows, for example, rate limit per minute and per hour, and per any arbitrary window size.

faqs:
  - q: Why can't I use the regular Rate Limiting plugin to set multiple limits and window sizes?
    a: You could use the regular Rate Limiting plugin to just set multiple limits, but the regular plugin doesn't support configurable window sizes.

## Enable rate limiting

Enable the [Rate Limiting Advanced plugin](/plugins/rate-limiting-advanced/) for the Gateway Service.

{% entity_examples %}
entities:
  plugins:
    - name: rate-limiting-advanced
      service: example-service
      config:
        namespace: example-namespace
        limit:
        - 10
        - 100
        window_size:
        - 60
        - 3600
{% endentity_examples %}

Each *nth* limit will apply to each *nth* window size.

This example applies rate limiting policies, one of which will trip when 10 hits have been counted in 60 seconds,
or the other when 100 hits have been counted in 3600 seconds. 

The number of configured window sizes and limits parameters must be equal (as shown above);
otherwise, an error occurs.

## Validate

After configuring the Rate Limiting Advanced plugin, you can verify that it was configured correctly and is working, by sending more requests then allowed in the configured time limit.

{% validation rate-limit-check %}
iterations: 11
url: '/anything'
{% endvalidation %}
