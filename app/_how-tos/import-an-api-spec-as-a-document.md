## Select a specification

In your workspace, click **Import** and select the source of the import: **File**, **URL**, or **Clipboard**. Based on the source, either choose a file, enter a URL, or copy your API specification.

## Scan the specification

Click **Scan**. You can review the resources to import, then click **Import**

## Open the document

Open the document created to check your specification. You can see three different views:

* On the left you can see an overview of the specification, with sections that you can expand. You can click the different elements to highlight them in the specification.
* In the middle, you can see the specification as it was imported. You can also see if there are any warnings or errors.
* On the right, you can see a preview of the rendering of the specification.
