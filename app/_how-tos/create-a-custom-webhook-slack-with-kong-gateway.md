  q: How can I create a custom webhook to push information to Slack using Event Hooks?
  a: With an application URL from Slack, you can configure an [Event Hook](/gateway/entities/event-hook/) using the `webhook-custom` handler that can `POST` event information to Slack.
prereqs:
  inline:
    - title: A Slack webhook application

    - title: cURL
      include_content: prereqs/tools/curl

## 1. Configure an Event Hook using the `webhook-custom` handler


Using the `webhook-custom` handler, you can configure an Event Hook that listens for events on a source. The `webhook-custom` handler offers a template that you can configure to create a custom webhook. In this tutorial, we will configure an Event Hook that issues a `POST` request when a `crud` event happens on the Consumer entity. That `POST` request will be made to a Slack webhook application containing a custom message describing the event. 

{% entity_example %}
type: event_hook
data:
  source: "crud"
  event: "consumers"
  handler: "webhook-custom"
  on_change: true
  config:
    method: "POST"
    url: $SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL
    headers:
      "Content-type": "application/json"
    payload:
      text: "new consumer added"
formats:
  - admin-api
{% endentity_example %}

Posting this will result in a `200` response. The `config` body in the Event Hook contains information about the webhook that was created: 

* **`"method": "POST"`**: The method we are using in the webhook.
* **`"url": "$SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL"`**: The URL of the webhook. In this case, we are using the Slack URl that we created and set as an environment variable. 
* **`"payload"`**: What this webhook will `POST`. 


## 2. Validate the webhook


{:.warning}
> **Important**:  Before you can use Event Hooks for the first time, {{site.base_gateway}} needs to be [reloaded](/how-to/restart-kong-gateway-container/).


Use the Admin API to create a new Consumer: 


{% entity_example %}
type: consumer
data:
  username: my-consumer
formats:
  - admin-api
{% endentity_example %}

Slack will post a message to the channel informing you that a Consumer was added.
