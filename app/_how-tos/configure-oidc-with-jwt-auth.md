## Enable the OpenID Connect plugin with JWT authentication

Using the Keycloak and {{site.base_gateway}} configuration from the [prerequisites](#prerequisites), 
set up an instance of the OpenID Connect plugin with bearer authentication. The stateless JWT Access Token authentication is named `bearer` in the OpenID Connect plugin.

We're also enabling the password grant so that you can test retrieving the bearer auth token. 

Enable the OpenID Connect plugin on the `example-service` Service:

{% entity_examples %}
entities:
  plugins:
    - name: openid-connect
      service: example-service
      config:
        issuer: ${issuer}
        client_id:
        - ${client-id}
        client_secret:
        - ${client-secret}
        client_auth:
        - client_secret_post
        auth_methods:
        - bearer
        - password
        bearer_token_param_type:
        - query
variables:
  issuer:
    value: $ISSUER
  client-id:
    value: $CLIENT_ID
  client-secret:
    value: $CLIENT_SECRET
{% endentity_examples %}

In this example:
* `issuer`, `client ID`, `client secret`, and `client auth`: Settings that connect the plugin to your IdP (in this case, the sample Keycloak app).
* `auth_methods`: Specifies that the plugin should use bearer authentication and the password grant.
* `bearer_token_param_type`: Restricts token lookup to the query string only.

{% include_cached plugins/oidc/client-auth.md %}

## Retrieve the bearer token

Check that you can recover the token by sending a request to the Service with the basic authentication credentials created in the [prerequisites](#prerequisites):

{% validation request-check %}
url: /anything
method: GET
status_code: 200
user: "alex:doe"
display_headers: true
{% endvalidation %}

You'll see an `Authorization` header with your access token in the response.

When passing the token in a query string, you don't need to include the `Bearer` portion of the token.
Copy the token without `Bearer`, and export the value of the header to an environment variable:

```
export TOKEN='YOUR_TOKEN_WITHOUT_BEARER_PREFIX'
```

## Validate the token

Now, validate the setup by accessing the `example-route` Route and passing the bearer token in the query string:

{% validation request-check %}
url: /anything?access_token=$TOKEN
method: GET
status_code: 200
display_headers: true
{% endvalidation %}
