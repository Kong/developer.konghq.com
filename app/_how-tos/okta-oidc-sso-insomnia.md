## Create the SSO connection in Insomnia

Begin setting up SSO in Insomnia to get the single sign-on URL and audience URI you'll need for the Okta configuration.

1. In your Insomnia account settings, click your account and select **Enterprise Controls** from the dropdown.
1. Click **SSO** in the sidebar and then click **Create Connection**.
1. In the SSO settings, enter your company's domain.

Keep this window open while you configure the settings in Okta.

## Configure OIDC SSO in Okta

1. In Okta, navigate to **Applications > Applications** in the sidebar.
1. Click **Create App Integration**.
1. Select **OIDC - OpenID Connect**.
1. Select **Web Application**.
1. In the **Sign-in redirect URIs** field, enter the SSO URL from Insomnia. For example: `https://insomnia-dev.us.auth0.com/login/callback`.
1. Save your settings, and from the **General** tab of the application, copy and save your client ID and client secret.
1. Click **Security > API** in the sidebar and navigate to the auth server you want to use.
1. Copy the issuer URL for your authorization server.

## Enter the Okta information in the SSO settings in Insomnia

Now that Okta SSO is configured and you have the issuer URL, client ID, and client secret from Okta, you can finish configuring the SSO settings in Insomnia.

1. In the Insomnia SSO settings, enter the issuer URL, client ID, and client secret from Okta.
1. To verify the connection, click **Create connection**. If the connection is successful, you will get a message that says "Your OIDC connection has been successfully updated."

## Add users or groups to the application in Okta

Assign users or groups to the Okta app integration. They wonâ€™t be able to log in with SSO yet, but this step is required.

In Okta, [assign users or groups to the app integration](https://help.okta.com/en-us/content/topics/apps/apps-manage-assignments.htm).


## Invite users to Insomnia

Now that users or groups are assigned to the app in Okta, you can start inviting users to Insomnia. Once they accept the invite, they can log in to Insomnia with SSO.

1. In your Insomnia account settings, click your account at the top right and select **Your organizations**. 
1. Click the organization you configured SSO for.
1. Enter the emails of the users you added to the Okta app and click **Invite**.
