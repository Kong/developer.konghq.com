    q: How do I collect {{site.base_gateway}} metrics with the Prometheus plugin?
    a: |
        {{site.base_gateway}} supports Prometheus with the [Prometheus plugin](/plugins/prometheus/). It exposes {{site.base_gateway}} performance and proxied upstream service metrics on the `/metrics` endpoint. To collect metrics, enable the Prometheus plugin, configure a `prometheus.yml` file to expose {{site.base_gateway}} metrics, and then run a Prometheus server.

        Once you are done experimenting with Prometheus and {{site.base_gateway}}, you can use the following
        commands to stop the Prometheus server you created in this guide:

        ```sh
        docker stop kong-quickstart-prometheus
        ```

## Enable the Prometheus plugin

Before you configure Prometheus, enable the [Prometheus plugin](/plugins/prometheus/) on {{site.base_gateway}}:

{% entity_examples %}
entities:
  plugins:
    - name: prometheus
      config:
        status_code_metrics: true
{% endentity_examples %}

## Configure Prometheus

Create a `prometheus.yml` file:

```sh
touch prometheus.yml
```

Now, add the following to the `prometheus.yml` file to configure Prometheus to scrape {{site.base_gateway}} metrics:

```yaml
scrape_configs:
 - job_name: 'kong'
   scrape_interval: 5s
   static_configs:
     - targets: ['kong-quickstart-gateway:8001']
```
{: data-deployment-topology="on-prem" }

```yaml
scrape_configs:
 - job_name: 'kong'
   scrape_interval: 5s
   static_configs:
     - targets: ['kong-quickstart-gateway:8100']
```
{: data-deployment-topology="konnect" }

Run a Prometheus server, and pass it the configuration file created in the previous step:

```sh
docker run -d --name kong-quickstart-prometheus \
  --network=kong-quickstart-net -p 9090:9090 \
  -v $(PWD)/prometheus.yml:/etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml \
  prom/prometheus:latest
```

Prometheus will begin to scrape metrics data from {{site.base_gateway}}.

## Validate

You can validate that the plugin is collecting metrics by generating traffic to the example service. The following command generates 60 requests over one minute. 

Run the following in the same terminal:

{% validation traffic-generator %}
iterations: 60
url: '/anything'
sleep: 1
{% endvalidation %}

Run the following to query the collected `kong_http_requests_total` metric data:

```sh
curl -s 'localhost:9090/api/v1/query?query=kong_http_requests_total'
```

This should return something like the following:
```
{"status":"success","data":{"resultType":"vector","result":[{"metric":{"__name__":"kong_http_requests_total","code":"200","instance":"kong-quickstart-gateway:8001","job":"kong","route":"example-route","service":"example-service","source":"service","workspace":"default"},"value":[1749000790.826,"42"]}]}}
```
