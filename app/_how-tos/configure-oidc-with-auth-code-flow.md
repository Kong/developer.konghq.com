  q: How do I use an authorization code to open a session with my identity provider, letting users log in through a browser?
  a: Using the OpenID Connect plugin, set up the [auth code flow](/plugins/openid-connect/#authorization-code-flow) to connect to an identity provider (IdP) through a browser, and use session authentication to store open sessions. You can do this by specifying `authorization_code` and `session` in the `config.auth_methods` plugin settings.

## Enable the OpenID Connect plugin with the auth code flow

Using the Keycloak and {{site.base_gateway}} configuration from the [prerequisites](#prerequisites), 
set up an instance of the OpenID Connect plugin with the auth code flow and session authentication.

Enable the OpenID Connect plugin on the `example-service` Service:

{% entity_examples %}
entities:
  plugins:
    - name: openid-connect
      service: example-service
      config:
        issuer: ${issuer}
        client_id:
        - ${client-id}
        client_secret:
        - ${client-secret}
        client_auth:
        - client_secret_post
        auth_methods:
        - authorization_code
        - session
        response_mode: form_post
        preserve_query_args: true
        login_action: redirect
        login_tokens: null
        authorization_endpoint: http://localhost:8080
variables:
  issuer:
    value: $ISSUER
  client-id:
    value: $CLIENT_ID
  client-secret:
    value: $CLIENT_SECRET
{% endentity_examples %}

In this example:
* `issuer`, `client ID`, `client secret`, and `client auth`: Settings that connect the plugin to your IdP (in this case, the sample Keycloak app).
* `auth_methods`: Specifies that the plugin should use session auth and the authorization code flow.
* `response_mode`: Set to `form_post` so that authorization codes wonâ€™t get logged to access logs.
* `preserve_query_args`: Preserves the original request query arguments through the authorization code flow redirection.
* `login_action`: Redirects the client to the original request URL after the authorization code flow. This turns the POST request into a GET request, and the browser address bar is updated with the original request query arguments.
* `login_tokens`: Configures the plugin so that tokens aren't included in the browser address bar.
* `authorization_endpoint`: Sets a custom endpoint for authorization, overriding the endpoint returned by discovery through the IdP. 
We need this setting because we're running the example through Docker, otherwise the discovery endpoint will try to access an internal Docker host.

## Validate authorization code login

Access the Route you configured in the [prerequisites](#prerequisites) with some query arguments. 
In a new browser tab, navigate to the following:

```sh
http://localhost:8000/anything?hello=world
```

The browser should be redirected to the Keycloak login page. 

Let's check what happens if you access the same URL using cURL:

{% validation request-check %}
url: /anything?hello=world
method: GET
status_code: 302
display_headers: true
{% endvalidation %}

You should see a `302` response with the session access token in the response, and a `Location` header that shows where the request is being redirected to.
