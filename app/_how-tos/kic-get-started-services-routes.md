## How Kubernetes resources map to {{site.base_gateway}} entities

A Service inside Kubernetes is a way to abstract an application that is running on a set of Pods. This maps to two entities in {{site.base_gateway}}: Service and Upstream.

The Service entity in {{site.base_gateway}} holds the protocol information needed to talk to the upstream service and various other protocol-specific settings. The Upstream object defines load balancing and health-checking behavior.

Routes are configured using Gateway API or Ingress resources, such as `HTTPRoute`, `TCPRoute`, `GRPCRoute`, `Ingress` and more.

## Deploy an echo service

Let's start by deploying an `echo` service which returns information about the Kubernetes cluster:

```bash
kubectl apply -f {{ site.links.web }}/manifests/kic/echo-service.yaml -n kong
```

## Create an HTTPRoute / Ingress

To route traffic to the `echo` service, create an `HTTPRoute` or `Ingress` resource:

{% include_cached /k8s/httproute.md path='/echo' name='echo' service='echo' port='1027' skip_host=true %}

## Validate your configuration

Once the resource has been reconciled, you can call the `/echo` endpoint and {{ site.base_gateway }} will route the request to the `echo` service:

{% validation request-check %}
url: /echo
status_code: 200
on_prem_url: $PROXY_IP
konnect_url: $PROXY_IP
{% endvalidation %}
