tldr:
    q: How do I verify {{site.ee_product_name}} Docker image signatures?
    a: |
      {{site.base_gateway}} Docker container images are signed using [Cosign](https://github.com/sigstore/cosign), 
      with signatures published to the Docker Hub repository `kong/notary`.

      Because Kong uses Github Actions to build and release, Kong also uses Githubâ€™s OIDC identity to sign images.
      You can verify these signatures using the `cosign verify` command.

## Gather the digest information

{% include how-tos/steps/manifest-digest.md %}


## Verify image signature

Run the `cosign verify` command, substituting the `SHA-256` digest and image name from the previous step:

```sh
cosign verify \
  'kong/kong-gateway:3.10.0.0@sha256:ad58cd7175a0571b1e7c226f88ade0164e5fd50b12f4da8d373e0acc82547495' \
  --certificate-oidc-issuer='https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com' \
  --certificate-identity-regexp='https://github.com/Kong/kong-ee/.github/workflows/release.yml' \
  -a repo='Kong/kong-ee' \
  -a workflow='Package & Release'
```

Make sure that you've set the `COSIGN_REPOSITORY` in the [prerequisites](#prerequisites), or Cosign won't be able to find the image signature.

If verification is successful, the response will contain a summary of the checks that were performed:
```
Verification for index.docker.io/kong/kong-gateway@sha256:cb838b4090cfbfb9186be6e95fbeceabc8fdbf604400eaaca1561b1f510128eb --
The following checks were performed on each of these signatures:
  - The specified annotations were verified.
  - The cosign claims were validated
  - Existence of the claims in the transparency log was verified offline
  - The code-signing certificate was verified using trusted certificate authority certificates
```
