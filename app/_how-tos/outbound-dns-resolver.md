    content: |
      You need to create an [inbound Route 53 resolver endpoint](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/resolver-get-started.html) in your VPC to receive DNS queries from your Dedicated Cloud Gateway.

      After creating the endpoint, collect the IP addresses assigned to it and the domain zones you want to forward.

      Save them in environment variables:
      ```sh
      export RESOLVER_IPS='10.0.0.10,10.1.0.53'
      export FORWARD_ZONES='example.internal.dev,example2.internal.dev'
      ```

## Connect the resolver to your Dedicated Cloud Gateway

Use the Konnect API to configure forwarding rules that send DNS queries to your resolver:

<!--vale off-->
{% konnect_api_request %}
url: /v2/cloud-gateways/networks/$KONNECT_NETWORK_ID/private-dns
status_code: 201
method: POST
region: global
headers:
  - 'Accept: application/json'
  - 'Content-Type: application/json'
body:
  name: us-east-2 dns resolver
  private_dns_attachment_config:
    kind: aws-outbound-resolver
    dns_config:
      example.internal.dev:
        remote_dns_server_ip_addresses:
          - 10.0.0.10
      example2.internal.dev:
        remote_dns_server_ip_addresses:
          - 10.1.0.53
{% endkonnect_api_request %}
<!--vale on-->


## Validate

Once the resolver is configured, it may take a few minutes to become active, you can validate success by issuing a `GET` request to
[`/private-dns`](/api/konnect/cloud-gateways/#/operations/private-dns):

<!--vale off-->
{% konnect_api_request %}
url: /v2/cloud-gateways/networks/$KONNECT_NETWORK_ID/private-dns
status_code: 201
region: global
{% endkonnect_api_request %}
<!--vale on-->
