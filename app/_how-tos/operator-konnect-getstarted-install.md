## Install {{site.operator_product_name}}

The {{site.operator_product_name}} can deploy and manage Data Planes connected to a {{ site.konnect_short_name }} Control Plane. Configuration for services, routes, and plugins is managed entirely through {{site.konnect_short_name}} and propagated automatically to Data Planes.

## Create the `kong` namespace

Create the `kong` namespace in your Kubernetes cluster, which is where the Getting Started guide will run:

```sh
kubectl create namespace kong
```

## Install the Operator

{% include prereqs/products/operator.md raw=true v_maj=1 %}

{% include k8s/cert-manager.md %}

### Wait for readiness

Wait for the {{site.operator_product_name}}'s controller deployment to become available before proceeding, ensuring itâ€™s ready to manage resources:

{% include prereqs/products/operator-validate-deployment.md %}

Once the {{site.operator_product_name}} is ready, you can begin provisioning Gateway Control Planes and Data Planes using {{site.konnect_short_name}} CRDs.
