## 1. Enable the Request Transformer Advanced plugin

In this example, we expect the client to send requests with a JSON body containing customer details and a query parameter containing a customer ID.

We want to transform the request to:
* Specify a list of allowed JSON properties to ensure that only the expected properties are received by the upstream server
* Remove the customer ID from the query string and add it to the JSON body instead

Configure the [Request Transformer Advanced](/plugins/request-transformer-advanced) plugin with the transformations to perform:

<!--vale off-->
{% entity_examples %}
entities:
  plugins:
    - name: request-transformer-advanced
      config:
        allow:
          body:
            - customer_id
            - customer_name
            - customer_zipcode
        remove:
          querystring:
            - customer_id
        add:
          body:
            - 'customer_id:$(query_params["customer_id"])'         
{% endentity_examples %}
<!--vale on-->


## 2. Validate

To check that the request transformation is working, send a `POST` request with the `customer_id` as a query parameter and extra JSON properties in the request body:

<!--vale off-->
{% validation request-check %}
url: /anything?customer_id=abc123
status_code: 200
method: POST
headers:
    - 'Accept: application/json'
    - 'Content-Type: application/json'
body:
  customer_name: 'Jane Smith'
  customer_zipcode: '41563'
  customer_phone: 555-555-5555
{% endvalidation %}
<!--vale on-->

In this example, we're using [httpbin.konghq.com/anything](https://httpbin.konghq.com/#/Anything/post_anything) as the upstream. It returns anything that is passed to the request, which means the response contains the transformed request body received by the upstream:
```json
{
   "json":{
      "customer_id": "abc123", 
      "customer_name": "Jane Smith", 
      "customer_zipcode": "41563"
   }
}
```
