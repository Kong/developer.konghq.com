## How Kubernetes resources map to {{site.base_gateway}} entities

A Kubernetes Service represents an application running on a group of Pods. In {{site.base_gateway}}, this maps to a `Service` and `Upstream`.

* The **KongService** defines protocol-specific information and connection settings to reach the upstream application.
* The **Upstream** defines load balancing and health checking behavior across backend targets.

## Create a `KongService` 

The `KongService` resource is used to define an upstream service that {{site.konnect_short_name}} will route traffic to. This must include a reference to a `KonnectGatewayControlPlane` to associate the service with your Konnect environment.

<!-- vale off -->
{% konnect_crd %}
kind: KongService
apiVersion: configuration.konghq.com/v1alpha1
metadata:
  name: service
spec:
  name: service
  host: httpbin.konghq.com
  controlPlaneRef:
    type: konnectNamespacedRef
    konnectNamespacedRef:
      name: gateway-control-plane
{% endkonnect_crd %}
<!-- vale on -->

## Create a `KongRoute`

Define a `KongRoute` to expose the Service you created. The Route determines how requests are matched and routed to the associated Service.

<!-- vale off -->
{% konnect_crd %}
kind: KongRoute
apiVersion: configuration.konghq.com/v1alpha1
metadata:
  name: route
spec:
  name: route
  protocols:
  - http
  paths:
  - /
  serviceRef:
    type: namespacedRef
    namespacedRef:
      name: service
{% endkonnect_crd %}
<!-- vale on -->

## Validation

You can validate from the command line or [Gateway Manager UI](/gateway-manager/) to confirm that both the `KongService` and `KongRoute` have been provisioned and are in a valid state:


<!-- vale off -->
{% validation kubernetes-resource %}
kind: KongService
name: service
{% endvalidation %}
<!-- vale on -->

<!-- vale off -->
{% validation kubernetes-resource %}
kind: KongRoute
name: route
{% endvalidation %}
<!-- vale on -->
