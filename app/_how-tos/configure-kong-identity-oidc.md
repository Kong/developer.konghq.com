  q: How do I configure Kong Identity with OIDC?
  a: | 
    Create a Kong Identity auth server, scope, claim, and client. Configure the OpenID Connect (OIDC) plugin with your issuer URL, client ID, and client secret. Generate a client token by sending a POST request to `$ISSUER_URL/oauth/token` and use the access token in a header when you send a request to a protected  Gateway Service.

faqs:
  - q: How do I use Kong Identity with Consumer-scoped plugins and OIDC auth?
    a: |
      For Consumer-scoped plugins, do the following:
      - Create a Consumer per client in the respective control plane.
      - The OIDC plugin will map clients to Consumers using claims with the `consumer_claim` field.
      - Apply the Consumer-scoped plugin to the Consumer entity in the control plane.
      You don't need to migrate the client credential to a Consumer credential.
  - q: Can I retrieve my clientâ€™s secret again?
    a: |
      No, the secret is only shared once when the client is created. Store it securely.

## Configure the OIDC plugin

You can configure the [OIDC plugin](/plugins/openid-connect/) to use Kong Identity as the identity provider for your Gateway Services. In this example, you'll apply the plugin to the control plane globally, but you can alternatively apply it to the Gateway Service.

First, get the ID of the `quickstart` control plane you configured in the prerequisites:

<!--vale off-->
{% konnect_api_request %}
url: /v2/control-planes?filter%5Bname%5D%5Bcontains%5D=quickstart
status_code: 201
method: GET
{% endkonnect_api_request %}
<!--vale on-->

Export the control plane ID:
```sh
export CONTROL_PLANE_ID='YOUR-CONTROL-PLANE-ID'
```

Enable the OIDC plugin globally:
<!--vale off-->
{% konnect_api_request %}
url: /v2/control-planes/$CONTROL_PLANE_ID/core-entities/plugins/
status_code: 201
method: POST
headers:
  - 'Content-Type: application/json'
body:
  name: openid-connect
  config:
    issuer: $ISSUER_URL
    client_id: 
    - $CLIENT_ID
    client_secret:
    - $CLIENT_SECRET
    client_auth:
    - client_secret_post
    auth_methods:
    - client_credentials
    audience:
    - http://myhttpbin.dev
    client_credentials_param_type:
    - header
{% endkonnect_api_request %}
<!--vale on-->

In this example:
* `issuer`, `client ID`, `client secret`, and `client auth`: Settings that connect the plugin to your IdP (in this case, Kong Identity). 
* `auth_methods`: Specifies that the plugin should use client credentials (client ID and secret) for authentication.
* `client_credentials_param_type`: Restricts client credential lookup to request headers only.

## Access the Gateway service using the token 
Access the Gateway Service using the short-lived token generated by the authorization server from Kong Identity.
