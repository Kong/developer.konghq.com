  q: How do I view a SaaS GitLab project in Service Catalog?
  a: Install and authorize the SaaS GitLab integration in the {{site.konnect_short_name}} UI. Create a Service Catalog service and associate it with your GitLab project to display metadata and enable event tracking.

        You must have a [GitLab.com subscriptions](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/subscriptions/gitlab_com/) and the **Owner** role in the GitLab group to authorize the integration. You need a project in GitLab that you want to pull in to {{site.konnect_short_name}}.

## Authorize the GitLab integration

1. From the **Service Catalog** in {{site.konnect_short_name}}, select **[Integrations](https://cloud.konghq.com/us/service-catalog/integrations)**.
2. Click **GitLab**, then click **Add GitLab instance**.
3. Select **GitLab (SaaS)**, authorize GitLab to connect your account, and enter `gitlab` for your instance name.

## Create a service in Service Catalog

Create a service that you'll map to your GitLab resources:

<!--vale off-->
{% konnect_api_request %}
url: /v1/catalog-services
method: POST
status_code: 201
region: us
body:
  name: billing
  display_name: Billing Service
{% endkonnect_api_request %}
<!--vale on-->

Export the service ID:

```sh
export GITLAB_SERVICE_ID='YOUR-SERVICE-ID'
```

## List GitLab resources

Before you can map your GitLab resources to a service in Service Catalog, you first need to find the resources that are pulled in from GitLab:

<!--vale off-->
{% konnect_api_request %}
url: /v1/resources?filter%5Bintegration.name%5D=gitlab
method: GET
region: us
status_code: 200
{% endkonnect_api_request %}
<!--vale on-->

{:.info}
> You might need to manually sync your GitLab integration for resources to appear. From the {{site.konnect_short_name}} UI by navigating to the GitLab integration you just installed and selecting **Sync Now** from the **Actions** dropdown menu.

Export the resource ID you want to map to the service:

```sh
export GITLAB_RESOURCE_ID='YOUR-RESOURCE-ID'
```

## Map resources to a service

Now, you can map the GitLab resource to the service:

<!--vale off-->
{% konnect_api_request %}
url: /v1/resource-mappings
method: POST
status_code: 201
region: us
body:
  service: billing
  resource: $GITLAB_RESOURCE_ID
{% endkonnect_api_request %}
<!--vale on-->


## Validate the mapping

To confirm that the GitLab resource is now mapped to the intended service, list the serviceâ€™s mapped resources:

<!--vale off-->
{% konnect_api_request %}
url: /v1/catalog-services/$GITLAB_SERVICE_ID/resources
method: GET
status_code: 200
region: global
{% endkonnect_api_request %}
<!--vale on-->
