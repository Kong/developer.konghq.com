    a: Yes, you can copy and paste your pre-request scripts directly from Postman into an Insomnia pre-request script.

## Add a pre-request script

In this example, we'll configure a pre-request script that sets a variable in the request:

1. In Insomnia, navigate to the "Flight Service 0.1.0" document.
1. Click the **Collection** tab.
1. In the sidebar of your collection, select the **Get a specific flight by flight number** request.
1. Click the **Scripts** tab on the request.
1. Insomnia provides example pre-request scripts. From the **Pre-request** tab, click **Variable Snippets** at the bottom of the pane and select **Set an environment variable**.
1. In the example script, replace `variable_name` with `flightNumber` and `variable_value` with `KA0285`. The script should look like the following:
```javascript
insomnia.environment.set("flightNumber", "KA0285");
```

## Validate the pre-request script

Now that we created a pre-request script, we can validate it by sending a GET request to the `/flights/{flightNumber}` endpoint.

Click **Send**. You should get a `200` status code and the following response:
```json
{
	"number": "KA0285",
	"route_id": "LHR-SFO",
	"scheduled_arrival": "2024-04-03T11:10:00Z",
	"scheduled_departure": "2024-04-03T22:15:00Z"
}
```
