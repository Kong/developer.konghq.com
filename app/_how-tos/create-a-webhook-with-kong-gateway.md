## Create a webhook

The `webhook` handler is used to configure webhooks that make a `POST` request to the URL provided during configuration. The Event Hook will push information to this URL with the event data. In this guide you will configure an Event Hook that will issue a `POST` request every time an event type `consumers` has a CRUD event. 

Using the Admin API, create an Event Hook on the [Consumers](/gateway/entities/consumer/) event by issuing a `POST` request to the `/event-hooks` endpoint.

{% entity_example %}
type: event_hook
data:
  source: "crud"
  event: "consumers"
  handler: "webhook"
  on_change: true
  config:
    url: $WEBHOOK_URL
formats:
  - admin-api
{% endentity_example %}

Issuing this `POST` request will send a request of type `ping` to the webhook URL verifying that the webhook is configured correctly.


## Validate the webhook

{:.warning}
> **Important**:  Before you can use Event Hooks for the first time, {{site.base_gateway}} needs to be reloaded.

Using the Admin API create a new Consumer: 

{% entity_example %}
type: consumer
data:
  username: my-consumer
formats:
  - admin-api
{% endentity_example %}

Verify on [`https://webhook.site`](https://webhook.site) that you received a `POST` request. It will look like this: 

```json
{
  "entity": {
    "username_lower": "my-consumer",
    "id": "ea87c99f-36f1-41c9-8543-7b13ee2b5dfe",
    "updated_at": 1734547295,
    "type": 0,
    "username": "my-consumer",
    "created_at": 1734547295
  },
  "schema": "consumers",
  "source": "crud",
  "event": "consumers",
  "operation": "create"
}
```

This response body contains the `operation`, the `source`, and the `event`, confirming that a new Consumer was created.
