## Set up the `proxy-cache` plugin

Use the `KongPlugin` CRD to enable proxy caching on a `KongService`. The following example:

* Caches `200 OK` responses
* Applies to `GET` and `HEAD` requests
* Targets responses with `application/json` content type
* Stores cached data in memory
* Sets the cache TTL to 300 seconds (5 minutes)

{% entity_example %}
type: plugin
cluster_plugin: false
data:
  name: proxy-cache-all-endpoints
  plugin: proxy-cache
  config:
    response_code:
    - 200
    request_method:
    - GET
    - HEAD
    content_type:
    - application/json
    cache_ttl: 300
    strategy: memory

  kongservice: service
  other_plugins: rate-limiting
{% endentity_example %}

## Validation

Send six requests to the same endpoint and inspect the cache status. The first request will miss, but subsequent ones will hit because they are served from the cache.

{% validation rate-limit-check %}
iterations: 6
url: '/anything'
headers:
  - 'apikey:example-key'
on_prem_url: $PROXY_IP
konnect_url: $PROXY_IP
grep: "(Status|< HTTP)"
message: null
output:
  explanation: |
    The first request results in `X-Cache-Status: Miss`. This means that the request is sent to the upstream service. The next four responses return `X-Cache-Status: Hit` which indicates that the request was served from a cache. If you receive a `HTTP 429` from the first request, wait 60 seconds for the rate limit timer to reset.
  expected:
    - value:
      - "< HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
      - "< X-Cache-Status: Miss"
    - value:
      - "< HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
      - "< X-Cache-Status: Hit"
    - value:

      - "< X-Cache-Status: Hit"
    - value:
      - "< HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
      - "< X-Cache-Status: Hit"
    - value:
      - "< HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
      - "< X-Cache-Status: Hit"
    - value:
      - "< HTTP/1.1 429 Too Many Requests"
