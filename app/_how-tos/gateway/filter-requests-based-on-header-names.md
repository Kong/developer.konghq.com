   You can use the serverless Pre-Function plugin to detect headers in a request, and either let the request through or terminate it. 
   
   In this tutorial, we'll enable the Pre-Function plugin in the `access` phase, where it will look for a request with the header `X-Custom-Auth`.
   If the header exists in the request, it lets the request through. If the header doesn’t exist, it terminates the request early.

## Enable the Pre-Function plugin

The [Pre-Function](/plugins/pre-function/) plugin lets you execute Lua code that runs before other plugins in a particular phase. In this case, we're using the plugin to look for a specific header, `x-custom-auth`. 

The following example applies the Pre-Function plugin globally, in the access phase:

{% entity_examples %}
entities:
  plugins:
    - name: pre-function
      config:
        access:
          - |
              -- Get list of request headers
              local custom_auth = kong.request.get_header("x-custom-auth")

              -- Terminate request early if the custom authentication header
              -- does not exist
              if not custom_auth then
                return kong.response.exit(401, "Invalid Credentials")
              end
{% endentity_examples %}

## Validate

Let's test that the code will terminate the request when no header is passed:

{% validation request-check %}
url: '/anything'
status_code: 401
display_headers: true
message: Invalid Credentials
{% endvalidation %}

You should get a `401` status code with the message `Invalid Credentials`.

Now, test the code by making a valid request with the `x-custom-auth` header:

{% validation request-check %}
url: '/anything'
status_code: 200
headers:
- 'x-custom-auth: example'
display_headers: true
{% endvalidation %}

This time, the request will pass through and you'll see a `200` response.
