description: Configure the OpenID Connect plugin together with Consumer Groups to map Consumer Groups to IdP client claims.

tldr:
  q: How do I map Consumer Groups to IdP client claims with OpenID Connect?
  a: |
    Use the OpenID Connect plugin with [Consumer Groups](/gateway/entities/consumer-group/) for authorization and dynamically map claim values to Consumer Groups. This only allows IdP users that have a matching Consumer Group in {{site.base_gateway}} to access your Services, giving you more control over which clients have access to {{site.base_gateway}}.
  
    Set up `client_credential` authentication and enable Consumer Group mapping by setting a claim to map to.

## Enable the OpenID Connect plugin

Using the Keycloak and {{site.base_gateway}} configuration from the [prerequisites](#prerequisites), 
set up an instance of the OpenID Connect plugin. In this example, we're using the `client_credentials` grant with the `tier` Consumer Group claim.

Enable the OpenID Connect plugin on the `example-service` Service:

{% entity_examples %}
entities:
  plugins:
    - name: openid-connect
      service: example-service
      config:
        issuer: ${issuer}
        auth_methods:
        - client_credentials
        consumer_groups_claim:
        - tier
variables:
  issuer:
    value: $ISSUER
{% endentity_examples %}

In this example:
* `issuer`: Settings that connect the plugin to your IdP (in this case, the sample Keycloak app).
* `auth_methods`:  Specifies that the plugin should use the client credentials grant.
* `consumer_group_claim`: Looks for a client claim name in the token payload and maps it to the Consumer Group entity by the entity's `name` value.

## Create a Consumer Group

First, let's try to access the Service without a matching Consumer Group.
Request the Service with the basic authentication credentials created in the [prerequisites](#prerequisites):

{% validation request-check %}
url: /anything
method: GET
status_code: 401
headers:
  - 'Authorization: Basic {{ "kong:wrong-secret" | base64 }}'
display_headers: true
{% endvalidation %}

You should get a `401 Unauthorized` error code, which means the Service is protected by claim authorization.

Create a Consumer Group with a name that matches the client claim value in your IdP, in this case `gold`:

{% entity_examples %}
entities:
  consumer_groups:
    - name: gold
{% endentity_examples %}

## Verify Consumer Group authorization

Now, your configured Consumer Group can access the `example-route` Route by using client name and client secret in `client-name:client-secret` format:

{% validation request-check %}
url: /anything
method: GET
status_code: 200
headers:
  - 'Authorization: Basic {{ "kong:$CLIENT_SECRET" | base64 }}'
display_headers: true
{% endvalidation %}

This time, you should get a `200` response. 
The OIDC plugin decodes the token it receives from the IdP, finds the client claim value, and maps it to our Consumer Group `gold`.
