    q: How do I recover {{site.konnect_short_name}} org audit logs?
    a: |
        Use replay jobs in {{site.konnect_short_name}} to recover audit logs. These are useful when you've missed audit log entries due to an error or a misconfigured audit log webhook. 

        Configure an audit log webhook in {{site.konnect_short_name}} with the SIEM endpoint, the access key, and the log format. Then, configure audit logs for your {{site.konnect_short_name}} org by adding the audit log webhook that you just configured. You can then navigate to your {{site.konnect_short_name}} org audit log configuration and click the **Replay** tab to recover audit logs from a specified time frame. 

        This tutorial uses SumoLogic, but you can apply the same steps to your SIEM provider.

        To complete this tutorial, you'll need an audit log destination and webhook configured. If you don't already have one configured, follow these steps:

        1. In the {{site.konnect_short_name}} UI, click [**Organization**](https://cloud.konghq.com/organization) in the sidebar.
        1. Click **Audit Logs Setup** in the sidebar.
        1. On the Webhook Destination tab, click **New Webhook**.
        1. Enter `SumoLogic` in the **Name** field.
        1. Enter your external endpoint that will receive audit log messages in the **Endpoint** field. For example: `https://endpoint4.collection.sumologic.com/receiver/v1/http/1234abcd`.
        1. Enter the access token from you SIEM in the **Authorization Header** field. 
           {{site.konnect_short_name}} will send this string in the `Authorization` header of requests to that endpoint.
        1. Select "cef" from the **Log Format** dropdown menu.
        1. (Optional) Click **Disable SSL Verification** to disable SSL verification of the host endpoint when delivering payloads.
            
           {:.important}
           > We only recommend disabling SSL verification when using self-signed SSL certificates in a non-production environment as this can subject you to man-in-the-middle and other attacks.
        1. Click the **Konnect** tab.
        1. Navigate to the region you want to configure the webhook for.
        1. Click **Disabled**.
        1. Select your SIEM endpoint from the **Endpoint** dropdown menu.
        1. Click **Save**.

        To validate that the webhook is configured correctly, send an API request using the {{site.konnect_short_name}} API:

        <!--vale off-->
        {% konnect_api_request %}
        url: /v2/control-planes
        status_code: 201
        method: GET
        {% endkonnect_api_request %}
        <!--vale on-->

        This triggers a log in SumoLogic. Sometimes it can take a minute to populate the logs.

faqs:
  - q: How many days of {{site.konnect_short_name}} org audit logs can I recover?
    a: |
      {{site.konnect_short_name}} only collects audit logs from the past seven days, so you can only recover up to seven days of logs from the current date.

## Configure a replay job

In {{site.konnect_short_name}}, you can restore audit logs by configuring a replay job:

1. In the {{site.konnect_short_name}} UI, click [**Organization**](https://cloud.konghq.com/organization) in the sidebar.
1. Click **Audit Logs Setup** in the sidebar.
1. Click the **Konnect** tab.
1. Navigate to the region you want to configure the replay job for.
1. Click the **Replay** tab.
1. Select `Last 6 hours` from the **Replay Time Range** dropdown menu.
1. Click **Send Replay**.

The replay job will now display one of the following statuses:

<!--vale off-->
{% table %}
columns:
  - title: Status
    key: status
  - title: Description
    key: description
rows:
  - status: "Unconfigured"
    description: The job has not been set up. This is the job's initial state.
  - status: "Accepted"
    description: The job has been accepted for scheduling.
  - status: "Pending"
    description: The job has been scheduled.
  - status: "Running"
    description: The job is in progress. When a replay job is `running`, a request to update the job will return a `409` response code until it has completed or failed.
  - status: "Completed"
    description: The job has finished with no errors.
  - status: "Failed"
    description: The job has failed.
{% endtable %}
<!--vale on-->


## Validate

Once the replay job is marked as Complete, you can view the recovered audit logs in your SIEM provider. If you're using SumoLogic, navigate to the [log search](https://service.sumologic.com/log-search) and search for `_source=Konnect`. You will see logs like the following:
