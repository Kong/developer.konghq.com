  q: How do I connect a GitHub repository to my {{site.konnect_catalog}} service?
  a: Install the GitHub integration in {{site.konnect_short_name}} and authorize access to one or more repositories, then link a repository to your {{site.konnect_catalog}} service to display metadata and enable event tracking.

      content: |
        You must have sufficient permissions in GitHub to authorize third-party applications and install the {{site.konnect_short_name}} GitHub App.

        You need a repository that you want to pull in to {{site.konnect_short_name}}. You can grant access to either all repositories or selected repositories during the authorization process. The {{site.konnect_short_name}} app can be managed in your GitHub account under **Applications > GitHub Apps**.

## Install and authorize the GitHub integration

1. From the **Service Catalog** in {{site.konnect_short_name}}, select **[Integrations](https://cloud.konghq.com/us/service-catalog/integrations)**. 
2. Click **GitHub**, then click **Add GitHub Instance**.
3. Authorize the GitHub integration. This will take you to GitHub, where you can grant {{site.konnect_short_name}} access to either **All Repositories** or **Select repositories**. 
1. Enter `github` as your instance name.

The {{site.konnect_short_name}} application can be managed from GitHub as a [GitHub Application](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/using-github-apps/authorizing-github-apps).

## Create a service in Service Catalog

Create a service that you'll map to your GitHub resources:

<!--vale off-->
{% konnect_api_request %}
url: /v1/service-catalog/services
method: POST
status_code: 201
region: us
headers:
  - 'Accept: application/json, application/problem+json'
  - 'Content-Type: application/json'
body:
  name: billing
  display_name: Billing Service
{% endkonnect_api_request %}
<!--vale on-->

Export the service ID:

```sh
export GITHUB_SERVICE_ID='YOUR-SERVICE-ID'
```

## List GitHub resources

Before you can map your GitHub resources to a service in Service Catalog, you first need to find the resources that are pulled in from GitHub:

<!--vale off-->
{% konnect_api_request %}
url: /v1/service-catalog/resources?filter%5Bintegration.name%5D=github
method: GET
region: us
status_code: 200
headers:
  - 'Accept: application/json, application/problem+json'
  - 'Content-Type: application/json'
{% endkonnect_api_request %}
<!--vale on-->

Export the resource ID you want to map to the service:

```sh
export GITHUB_RESOURCE_ID='YOUR-RESOURCE-ID'
```

## Map resources to a service

Now, you can map the GitHub resource to the service:

<!--vale off-->
{% konnect_api_request %}
url: /v1/service-catalog/resource-mappings
method: POST
status_code: 201
region: us
headers:
  - 'Accept: application/json, application/problem+json'
  - 'Content-Type: application/json'
body:
  service: billing
  resource: $GITHUB_RESOURCE_ID
{% endkonnect_api_request %}
<!--vale on-->


## Validate the mapping

To confirm that the GitHub resource is now mapped to the intended service, list the serviceâ€™s mapped resources:

<!--vale off-->
{% konnect_api_request %}
url: /v1/service-catalog/services/$GITHUB_SERVICE_ID/resources
method: GET
status_code: 200
region: global
headers:
  - 'Accept: application/json'
{% endkonnect_api_request %}
<!--vale on-->
