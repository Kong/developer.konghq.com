    Get started with Kong Identity by setting up an Authorization Server, Claims, Scopes and clients, then configuring the OpenID Connect plugin in a {{site.konnect_short_name}} Control Plane using the APIs.

## Pre-requisite
Opt-in to Kong Identity on the Labs page in your Konnect org

## Create an auth server in Kong Identity with the appropriate audience
It is recommended to have different auth servers for different env or different subsidiaries. Auth Server name is unique per org, per Konnect region. Auth Server ID, Issuer and Metadata_url is generated as part of the response

<!--vale off-->
{% control_plane_request %}
url: /v1/auth-servers
status_code: 200
method: POST
headers:
  - 'Authorization: Bearer $KONNECT_TOKEN'
  - 'Content-Type: application/json'
body:
  name: "Appointments Dev"
  audience: "http://myhttpbin.dev"
  description: "auth server for Appointment's dev environment"
{% endcontrol_plane_request %}
<!--vale on-->


## Configure the auth server with scopes and custom claims 
Advanced settings also enable dynamic custom claims. Claim ID and Scope ID are generated as part of the response. Scope names are unique per auth server. Claims are not unique


<!--vale off-->
{% control_plane_request %}
url: /v1/auth-servers/$auth-server-ID/scopes 
status_code: 200
method: POST
headers:
  - 'Authorization: Bearer $KONNECT_TOKEN'
  - 'Content-Type: application/json'
body:
  name: "Scope"
  description: "Scope Description"
  default: false
  include_in_metadata: false
  enabled: true
{% endcontrol_plane_request %}
<!--vale on-->

<!--vale off-->
{% control_plane_request %}
url: /v1/auth-servers/$auth-server-ID/claims 
status_code: 200
method: POST
headers:
  - 'Authorization: Bearer $KONNECT_TOKEN'
  - 'Content-Type: application/json'
body:
  name: "Claim"
  value: "Claim Value"
  include_in_token": true
  "include_in_all_scopes": false
  "include_in_scopes": ["scope123", "scope456"]
  "enabled": true

{% endcontrol_plane_request %}
<!--vale on-->


## Create a client in the Auth Server
Client is the machine to machine credential. Client has a “grant type” that can take values of client_credentials, implicit, authorization_code. An existing Client ID and Client Secret can be imported in the auth server. A client ID and client secret can also be automatically be created for the client. Token duration (in seconds) is configured per client


<!--vale off-->
{% control_plane_request %}
url: /v1/auth-servers/1234/clients
status_code: 201
method: POST
headers:
  - 'Authorization: Bearer $KONNECT_TOKEN'
  - 'Content-Type: application/json'
body:
  name: Client
  grant_types:
    - client_credentials
  allow_all_scopes: false
  allow_scopes:
    - $scope-id
  redirect_uris:
    - https://client.com/callback
  login_uri: https://client.com/login
  access_token_duration: 3600
  id_token_duration: 3600
  response_types:
    - id_token
    - token
{% endcontrol_plane_request %}
<!--vale on-->

## Apply OpenID Connect plugin to a Control plane using Kong Identity as the IdP
You can use the OIDC plugin to use Kong Identity as the identity provider for your GW services. Apply an OIDC plugin to the control plane at a Global scope. This plugin can be applied at a Service level as well. Add the issuer generated in the auth server in the OIDC Issuer field. 

## Generate a token for the client
Generate a token for the client by making a call to the issuer URL. Use this generated token to access the GW service.

<!--vale off-->
{% control_plane_request %}
url: $issuer-url-from-auth-server
status_code: 201
method: POST
headers:
  - 'Authorization: Bearer $KONNECT_TOKEN'
  - 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded'
body:
  grant_types = client_credentials
  client_id = $generated-client-ID
  client_secret = $generated-client-secret
  scope = $scope-name
  
{% endcontrol_plane_request %}
<!--vale on-->

## Access the Gateway service using the token 
Access the Gateway Service using the short lived token generated by the authorization server from Kong Identity
