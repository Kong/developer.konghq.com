## Create a Consumer

[Consumers](/gateway/entities/consumer/) let you identify the client that's interacting with {{site.base_gateway}}.
We're going to use basic [authentication](/gateway/authentication/) in this tutorial, so the Consumer needs a username and password to access any {{site.base_gateway}} Services.

Create a Consumer:

{% entity_examples %}
entities:
  consumers:
    - username: jsmith
      basicauth_credentials:
       - username: jsmith
         password: my-password
{% endentity_examples %}

## Enable authentication

Authentication lets you identify a Consumer. In this how-to, we'll be using the [Basic Authentication plugin](/plugins/basic-auth/) for authentication, which allows users to authenticate with a username and password when they make a request.

Enable the plugin globally, which means it applies to all {{site.base_gateway}} Services and Routes:

{% entity_examples %}
entities:
  plugins:
    - name: basic-auth
      config:
        hide_credentials: true
{% endentity_examples %}

## Validate

When a Consumer authenticates with basic auth, the authorization header must be base64-encoded. For example, since we are using `jsmith` as the username and `my-password` as the password, then the fieldâ€™s value is the base64 encoding of `jsmith:my-password`, or `anNtaXRoOm15LXBhc3N3b3Jk`.

First, run the following to verify that unauthorized requests return an error:

<!--vale off-->
{% validation unauthorized-check %}
url: /anything
headers:
  - 'authorization: Basic wrongpassword'
{% endvalidation %}
<!--vale on-->

Then, run the following command to test Consumer authentication:

{% validation request-check %}
url: '/anything'
display_headers: true
headers:
  - 'authorization: Basic anNtaXRoOm15LXBhc3N3b3Jk'
status_code: 200
{% endvalidation %}
