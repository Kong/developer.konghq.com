## Configure the AWS API Gateway integration

Before you can discover APIs in Service Catalog, you must configure the AWS API Gateway integration.

{% include /service-catalog/aws-api-gateway-integration.md %}

## Create a service in Service Catalog

Create a service that you'll map to your AWS API Gateway resources:

<!--vale off-->
{% konnect_api_request %}
url: /v1/catalog-services
method: POST
status_code: 201
region: us
body:
  name: billing
  display_name: Billing Service
{% endkonnect_api_request %}
<!--vale on-->

Export the service ID:

```sh
export AWS_SERVICE_ID='YOUR-SERVICE-ID'
```

## List AWS API Gateway resources

Before you can map your AWS API Gateway resources to a service in Service Catalog, you first need to find the resources that are pulled in from AWS API Gateway:

<!--vale off-->
{% konnect_api_request %}
url: /v1/resources?filter%5Bintegration.name%5D=aws-api-gateway
method: GET
region: us
status_code: 200
{% endkonnect_api_request %}
<!--vale on-->

{:.info}
> You might need to manually sync your AWS API Gateway integration for resources to appear. From the {{site.konnect_short_name}} UI by navigating to the AWS API Gateway integration you just installed and selecting **Sync Now** from the **Actions** dropdown menu.

Export the resource ID you want to map to the service:

```sh
export AWS_RESOURCE_ID='YOUR-RESOURCE-ID'
```

## Map resources to a service

Now, you can map the AWS API Gateway resource to the service:

<!--vale off-->
{% konnect_api_request %}
url: /v1/resource-mappings
method: POST
status_code: 201
region: us
body:
  service: billing
  resource: $AWS_RESOURCE_ID
{% endkonnect_api_request %}
<!--vale on-->


## Validate the mapping

To confirm that the AWS API Gateway resource is now mapped to the intended service, list the serviceâ€™s mapped resources:

<!--vale off-->
{% konnect_api_request %}
url: /v1/catalog-services/$AWS_SERVICE_ID/resources
method: GET
status_code: 200
region: us
{% endkonnect_api_request %}
<!--vale on-->
