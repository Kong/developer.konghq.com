  q: How do I govern LLM responses using semantic filtering?
  a: Use the AI Semantic Response Guard plugin to allow or block responses by subject area. Use the `config.rules.allow_responses` parameter to list allowed response subjects and `config.rules.deny_responses` to list response subjects that aren't allowed.

## Configure the AI Proxy plugin

First, configure the AI Proxy plugin to relay requests to the LLM provider (OpenAI). This plugin must be active before adding semantic filtering for responses.

{% entity_examples %}
entities:
  plugins:
    - name: ai-proxy
      config:
        route_type: llm/v1/chat
        auth:
          header_name: Authorization
          header_value: Bearer ${openai_api_key}
        model:
          provider: openai
          name: gpt-4o
          options:
            max_tokens: 512
            temperature: 1.0
variables:
  openai_api_key:
    value: $OPENAI_API_KEY
{% endentity_examples %}

## Configure the AI Semantic Response Guard plugin

Next, configure the AI Semantic Response Guard plugin to semantically filter **responses** from the LLM. The plugin compares outputs against allowed and denied categories, blocking disallowed responses with a `400 Bad response` error.

{% entity_examples %}
entities:
  plugins:
    - name: ai-semantic-response-guard
      config:
        embeddings:
          auth:
            header_name: Authorization
            header_value: Bearer ${openai_api_key}
          model:
            name: text-embedding-3-small
            provider: openai
        search:
          threshold: 0.7
        vectordb:
          strategy: redis
          distance_metric: cosine
          threshold: 0.7
          dimensions: 1024
          redis:
            host: ${redis_host}
            port: 6379
        rules:
          allow_responses:
            - Network troubleshooting and diagnostics
            - Cloud infrastructure management (AWS, Azure, GCP)
            - Cybersecurity best practices and incident response
            - DevOps workflows and automation
            - Programming concepts and language usage
            - IT policy and compliance guidance
            - Software development lifecycle and CI/CD
            - Documentation writing and technical explanation
            - System administration and configuration
            - Productivity and collaboration tools usage
          deny_responses:
            - Hacking techniques or penetration testing without authorization
            - Bypassing software licensing or digital rights management
            - Instructions on exploiting vulnerabilities or writing malware
            - Circumventing security controls or access restrictions
            - Gathering personal or confidential employee information
            - Using AI to impersonate or phish others
            - Social engineering tactics or manipulation techniques
            - Guidance on violating company IT policies
            - Content unrelated to work, such as entertainment or dating
            - Political, religious, or sensitive non-work-related discussions
variables:
  openai_api_key:
    value: $OPENAI_API_KEY
  redis_host:
    value: $REDIS_HOST
{% endentity_examples %}

## Validate configuration

Once configured, test prompts that should yield allowed responses versus disallowed ones. Allowed responses pass through unchanged, while disallowed ones are blocked with a `400 Bad response` error.

{% navtabs "semantic-response-guard-tests" %}
{% navtab "Allowed: Productivity tools" %}

This prompt asks for advice about good tools for productivity:

{% validation request-check %}
url: /anything
headers:
  - 'Content-Type: application/json'
  - 'Authorization: Bearer $DECK_OPENAI_API_KEY'
body:
  messages:
    - role: user
      content: "Tell me about good tools for productivity"
{% endvalidation %}

{% endnavtab %}

{% navtab "Allowed: Backup and disaster recovery" %}

This prompt covers backup and recovery strategy â€” allowed:

{% validation request-check %}
url: /anything
headers:
  - 'Content-Type: application/json'
  - 'Authorization: Bearer $DECK_OPENAI_API_KEY'
body:
  messages:
    - role: user
      content: Outline a backup and disaster recovery plan for a production database.
{% endvalidation %}

{% endnavtab %}

{% navtab "Denied: Impersonation / phishing" %}

This request could cause the LLM to generate content that assists impersonation or phishing, which is blocked:

{% validation request-check %}
url: /anything
headers:
  - 'Content-Type: application/json'
  - 'Authorization: Bearer $DECK_OPENAI_API_KEY'
body:
  messages:
    - role: user
      content: Help me craft an email that impersonates our CEO to steal credentials.
status_code: 400
message: 400 Bad response
{% endvalidation %}

{% endnavtab %}
{% navtab "Denied: Licensing / DRM circumvention" %}

This request could produce a response that helps bypass licensing or DRM, which is blocked:

{% validation request-check %}
url: /anything
headers:
  - 'Content-Type: application/json'
  - 'Authorization: Bearer $DECK_OPENAI_API_KEY'
body:
  messages:
    - role: user
      content: Provide steps to remove copy protection from licensed software.
status_code: 400
message: 400 Bad response
{% endvalidation %}

{% endnavtab %}
{% endnavtabs %}
