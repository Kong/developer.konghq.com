    q: How do I rate limit a Consumer with {{site.base_gateway}}?
    a: Enable an authentication plugin and create a [Consumer](/gateway/entities/consumer/) with credentials, then enable the [Rate Limiting plugin](/plugins/rate-limiting/) on the new Consumer.

## Create a Consumer

[Consumers](/gateway/entities/consumer/) let you identify the client that's interacting with {{site.base_gateway}}.
We're going to use key [authentication](/gateway/authentication/) in this tutorial, so the Consumer needs an API key to access any {{site.base_gateway}} Services.

Add the following content to `kong.yaml` to create a Consumer:

{% entity_examples %}
entities:
  consumers:
    - username: jsmith
      keyauth_credentials:
        - key: example-key
{% endentity_examples %}

## Enable authentication

Authentication lets you identify a Consumer so that you can apply rate limiting.
This example uses the [Key Authentication](/plugins/key-auth/) plugin, but you can use any authentication plugin that you prefer.

Enable the plugin globally, which means it applies to all {{site.base_gateway}} Services and Routes:

{% entity_examples %}
entities:
  plugins:
    - name: key-auth
      config:
        key_names:
          - apikey
{% endentity_examples %}

## Enable rate limiting

Enable the [Rate Limiting plugin](/plugins/rate-limiting/) for the Consumer. 
In this example, the limit is 5 requests per minute and 1000 requests per hour.

{% entity_examples %}
entities:
  plugins:
    - name: rate-limiting
      consumer: jsmith
      config:
        minute: 5
        hour: 1000
{% endentity_examples %}

## Validate

You can run the following command to test the rate limiting as the Consumer:

{% validation rate-limit-check %}
iterations: 6
url: '/anything'
headers:
  - 'apikey:example-key'
{% endvalidation %}
