## Create a Consumer

[Consumers](/gateway/entities/consumer/) let you identify the client that's interacting with {{site.base_gateway}}.
We're going to use JWT [authentication](/gateway/authentication/) in this tutorial, so the Consumer needs a key and secret to access any {{site.base_gateway}} Services. We're specifying the key and secret here, but you can leave it out of the configuration in production if you want {{site.base_gateway}} to autogenerate it. 

Create a Consumer:

{% entity_examples %}
entities:
  consumers:
    - username: jsmith
      jwt_secrets:
         - algorithm: HS256
           key: YJdmaDvVTJxtcWRCvkMikc8oELgAVNcz
           secret: C50k0bcahDhLNhLKSUBSR1OMiFGzNZ7X
{% endentity_examples %}

## Enable authentication

Authentication lets you identify a Consumer. In this how-to, we'll be using the [JWT plugin](/plugins/jwt/) for authentication, which allows users to authenticate with a JWT token when they make a request.

Enable the plugin globally, which means it applies to all {{site.base_gateway}} Services and Routes:

{% entity_examples %}
entities:
  plugins:
    - name: jwt
      config:
        header_names: 
        - authorization
        key_claim_name: iss
{% endentity_examples %}

## Sign the Consumer credential

Since we specified the `HS256` algorithm when we were configuring the Consumer credentials, we need to sign our credential before we can use it for authentication. JWT credentials are signed with a header, payload, and the secret.

The header value is:

```json
{
    "typ": "JWT",
    "alg": "HS256"
}
```
{:.no-copy-code}

Since we configured `iss` for the `config.key_claim_name`, we'll specify the Consumer's key in the `iss` payload:

```json
{
   "iss": "YJdmaDvVTJxtcWRCvkMikc8oELgAVNcz"
}
```
{:.no-copy-code}

The secret is the value we set in the Consumer credentials previously:
```
C50k0bcahDhLNhLKSUBSR1OMiFGzNZ7X
```
{:.no-copy-code}

Using the [JWT debugger](https://jwt.io) with the header (`HS256`), claims (`iss`), and `secret` associated with this `key`, youâ€™ll end up with a JWT token of `eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJZSmRtYUR2VlRKeHRjV1JDdmtNaWtjOG9FTGdBVk5jeiIsImV4cCI6MTQ0MjQzMDA1NCwibmJmIjoxNDQyNDI2NDU0LCJpYXQiOjE0NDI0MjY0NTR9.WuLdHyvZGj2UAsnBl6YF9A4NqGQpaDftHjX18ooK8YY`. 

Save this as an environment variable:
```bash
export JWT_TOKEN="eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJZSmRtYUR2VlRKeHRjV1JDdmtNaWtjOG9FTGdBVk5jeiIsImV4cCI6MTQ0MjQzMDA1NCwibmJmIjoxNDQyNDI2NDU0LCJpYXQiOjE0NDI0MjY0NTR9.WuLdHyvZGj2UAsnBl6YF9A4NqGQpaDftHjX18ooK8YY"
```

## Validate

When a Consumer authenticates with JWT, you can now use the signed credential in the authorization header.

First, run the following to verify that unauthorized requests return an error:

<!--vale off-->
{% validation unauthorized-check %}
url: /anything
headers:
  - 'authorization: Bearer wrongpassword'
  - 'Content-Type: application/json'
status_code: 401
{% endvalidation %}
<!--vale on-->

Then, run the following command to test Consumer authentication:

{% validation request-check %}
url: '/anything'
headers:
  - 'authorization: Bearer $JWT_TOKEN'
  - 'Content-Type: application/json'
status_code: 200
{% endvalidation %}
