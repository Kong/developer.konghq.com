  q: How do I retrieve a token using my identity provider's introspection endpoint?
  a: Using the OpenID Connect plugin, set up the [introspection auth workflow](/plugins/openid-connect/#introspection-authentication-workflow) to connect to an identity provider (IdP) to retrieve a token from the IdP's introspection endpoint, then use the token to access the upstream service.

## 1. Enable the OpenID Connect plugin with introspection

Using the Keycloak and {{site.base_gateway}} configuration from the [prerequisites](#prerequisites), 
set up an instance of the OpenID Connect plugin with introspection authentication.
We're also enabling the password grant so that you can test retrieving the auth token for introspection.

Enable the OpenID Connect plugin on the `example-service` Service:

{% entity_examples %}
entities:
  plugins:
    - name: openid-connect
      service: example-service
      config:
        issuer: ${issuer}
        client_id:
        - ${client-id}
        client_secret:
        - ${client-secret}
        client_auth:
        - client_secret_post
        auth_methods:
        - introspection
        - password
        bearer_token_param_type:
        - header
variables:
  issuer:
    value: $ISSUER
  client-id:
    value: $CLIENT_ID
  client-secret:
    value: $CLIENT_SECRET
{% endentity_examples %}

In this example:
* `issuer`, `client ID`, `client secret`, and `client auth`: Settings that connect the plugin to your IdP (in this case, the sample Keycloak app).
* `auth_methods`:  Specifies that the plugin should use introspection and the password grant for authentication.
* `bearer_token_param_type`: Restricts token lookup to the request headers only.

## 2. Retrieve the bearer token using introspection

Check that you can recover the token by requesting the Service with the basic authentication credentials created in the [prerequisites](#prerequisites):

{% validation request-check %}
url: /anything
method: GET
status_code: 200
user: "alex:doe"
display_headers: true
{% endvalidation %}

You'll see an `Authorization` header in the response. 

Export the value of the header to an environment variable:

```
export TOKEN='{your-bearer-token}'
```

## 3. Validate the token

Now, validate the setup by accessing the `example-route` Route and passing the token you retrieved using introspection:

{% validation request-check %}
url: /anything
method: GET
status_code: 200
display_headers: true
headers:
  - "Authorization: $TOKEN"
{% endvalidation %}
