## Enable Datakit

Test out Datakit by combining responses from two third-party API calls, then returning the result directly back to the client:

<!-- vale off-->
{% entity_examples %}
entities:
  plugins:
    - name: datakit
      service: example-service
      config:
        nodes:
        - name: AUTHOR
          type: call
          url: https://httpbin.konghq.com/json
        - name: UUID
          type: call
          url: https://httpbin.konghq.com/uuid
        - name: JOIN
          type: jq
          inputs:
            input1: AUTHOR.body
            input2: UUID.body
          jq: |
            {
              author: .input1.slideshow.author,
              uuid: .input2.uuid,
            }
        - name: EXIT
          type: exit
          inputs:
            body: JOIN
          status: 200
{% endentity_examples %}
<!--vale on-->

## Validate

Access the Service using the `/anything` path:

<!-- vale off -->
{% validation request-check %}
url: /anything
method: GET
status_code: 200
display_headers: true
{% endvalidation %}
<!-- vale on -->

You should get a `200` response with a UUID and a slideshow author:
```json
{"uuid":"cfa1e3f8-6618-4d1f-89f0-da97490d7caa","author":"Yours Truly"}
```
