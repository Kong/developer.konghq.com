decK's declarative configuration format is the canonical representation of a {{ site.base_gateway }} configuration in text form.

decK provides multiple tools for interacting with this declarative configuration:

{% table %}
columns:
  - title: Command
    key: command
  - title: Description
    key: description
rows:
  - command: |
      [openapi2kong](/deck/file/openapi2kong/)
    description: Convert an OpenAPI specification to {{ site.base_gateway }} Services and Routes.
  - command: |
      [kong2kic](/deck/file/kong2kic/)
    description: Convert a {{site.base_gateway}} declarative configuration file to [{{site.kic_product_name}}](/kubernetes-ingress-controller/) compatible CRDs. Supports both Gateway API and Ingress resources.
  - command: |
      [kong2tf](/deck/file/kong2tf/)
    description: Convert a {{site.base_gateway}} declarative configuration file to Terraform manifests ({{site.konnect_short_name}} only).
{% endtable %}

decK also provides commands to manipulate declarative configuration files:

{% endtable %}

decK provides a [`deck file lint`](/deck/file/lint/) command which can be used to ensure that declarative configuration files meet defined standards before being used to configure {{ site.base_gateway }}.

Finally, the [`deck file validate`](/deck/file/validate/) command validates the state file locally against static schemas. This won't detect any conflicts on the server, but is much faster than [`deck gateway validate`](/deck/gateway/validate/).
