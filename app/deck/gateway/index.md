decK can configure a running {{ site.base_gateway }} using the `deck gateway` command.

decK interacts with {{ site.base_gateway }} using the Kong Admin API.
This means that decK can manage any {{ site.base_gateway }} instance running in hybrid or traditional mode, or in any {{site.konnect_short_name}} deployment. However, it can't manage Gateways running in DB-less mode.

To learn about decK's APIOps capabilities, see [deck file](/deck/file).

decK provides the following `deck gateway` subcommands:

All of these commands require access to a running {{ site.base_gateway }} to function. If your Admin API requires a token, see the [configuration](/deck/gateway/configuration/) page.
