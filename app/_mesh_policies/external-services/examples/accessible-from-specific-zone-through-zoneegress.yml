title: 'ExternalService Accessible from specific zone through ZoneEgress'

description: ExternalService Accessible from specific zone through ZoneEgress

extended_description: |
  There are might be scenarios when a specific `ExternalService` might be accessible only through the specific zone. To make it work we should use the `kuma.io/zone` tag for external service. In order to make it work, we need a multi-zone setup with `ZoneIngress` and `ZoneEgress` deployed. Also,
  [zone egress](/docs/{{ page.release }}/production/cp-deployment/zoneegress) needs to be enabled.

  In this example, when all the conditions mentioned above are fulfilled if the service in `zone-1` is trying to set a connection with
  `httpbin.mesh` it will be redirected to the `ZoneEgress` instance within the `zone-1`. Next, this request goes to the `ZoneIngress` instance in `zone-2` which redirects it to the `ZoneEgress` cluster instance from where it goes outside to the `ExternalService`.
