Kubernetes resources can request configuration that {{site.kic_product_name}} can't translate into a valid {{site.base_gateway}} configuration. While the [admission webhook](/kubernetes-ingress-controller//admission-webhook/) can reject some invalid configurations during creation and the controller can fix some invalid configurations on its own, some configuration issues require you to review and fix them. When such issues arise, {{site.kic_product_name}} creates Kubernetes Events to help you identify problem resources and understand how to fix them.

To determine if there are any translation failures that you might want to fix, you can monitor the `ingress_controller_translation_count` [Prometheus metric](/kubernetes-ingress-controller/observability/prometheus/).

## Monitor for issues that require manual fixes

{{site.kic_product_name}}'s [Prometheus metrics](/kubernetes-ingress-controller/observability/prometheus/) include `ingress_controller_translation_count` and `ingress_controller_configuration_push_count` counters. Issues that require human intervention add `success=false` tallies to these counters.

{{site.kic_product_name}} also generates error logs with a `could not update kong admin` for configuration push failures.

## Finding problem resource Events

{{ site.kic_product_name }} provides Kubernetes Events to help understand the state of your system. Events occur when an invalid configuration is rejected by {{ site.base_gateway }} (`KongConfigurationApplyFailed`) or when an invalid configuration such as an upstream service that doesn't exist is detected (`KongConfigurationTranslationFailed`).

For more information, see [Events](/kubernetes-ingress-controller/observability/events/).

## Dumping generated Kong configuration

If the controller generates configuration that it cannot apply to Kong successfully, reviewing the generated configuration manually and/or applying it in a test environment can help locate potential causes.

Under normal operation, the controller doesn't store generated configuration; it is only sent to Kong's Admin API.  The `--dump-config` flag enables a diagnostic mode where the controller also saves generated configuration and {{ site.base_gateway }} responses to memory. You can retrieve these via the web interface of the diagnostic server at `host:10256/debug/config`.

To use the diagnostic mode:

1. Set the `--dump-config` flag (or `CONTROLLER_DUMP_CONFIG` environment variable) to `true`. Optionally set the `--dump-sensitive-config` flag to `true` to include un-redacted TLS certificate keys and credentials.

   If you're deploying with the Helm chart, add the following to your `values.yaml` file under the `controller` key:

   ```yaml
   ingressController:
    env:
      dump_config: "true"
      dump_sensitive_config: "true"
    ```

    To enable configuration dumping temporarily for an existing deployment, run the following command:

    ```bash
    kubectl set env -n kong deployment/kong-controller \
      CONTROLLER_DUMP_CONFIG="true" \
      CONTROLLER_DUMP_SENSITIVE_CONFIG="true" \
      -c ingress-controller
    ```

1. (Optional) Make a change to a Kubernetes resource that you know will reproduce the issue. If you are unsure what change caused the issue originally, you can omit this step.

1. Port forward to the diagnostic server:

   ```bash
   kubectl port-forward -n kong deployments/kong-controller 10256:10256
   ```

1. Retrieve successfully, or unsuccessfully, applied configurations:

   ```bash
   curl -s localhost:10256/debug/config/successful | jq .config > last_good.json
   curl -s localhost:10256/debug/config/failed | jq .config > last_bad.json
   ```

1. {% new_in 3.4 %} Retrieve the last error response body received from {{ site.base_gateway }}:
   ```bash
   curl -so raw_error_body.json localhost:10256/debug/config/raw-error
   ```

### Using dumped configuration

Once you have dumped configuration, take one of the following approaches to isolate issues:

- If you know of a specific Kubernetes resource change that reproduces the issue, diffing `last_good.json` and `last_bad.json` will show the change the controller is trying to apply unsuccessfully.

  ```bash
  diff -u last_good.json last_bad.json
  ```

- You can apply dumped configuration via the [`/config` Admin API endpoint](/api/gateway/admin-ee/#/operations/post-config) (DB-less mode) or using decK (DB-backed mode) to a test instance not managed by the ingress controller. This approach lets you review requests and responses (passing `--verbose 2` to decK will show all requests).

- To run a DB-less {{ site.base_gateway }} instance with Docker for testing purposes, run `curl https://get.konghq.com/quickstart | bash -s -- -D`.

  Once this image is running, run `curl http://localhost:8001/config --json @last_bad.json` to try applying the configuration and see any errors.

  You can also analyze the returned error response body from {{ site.base_gateway }} to understand the issue.
