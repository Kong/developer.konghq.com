  - q: Why is my KIC instance read-only in {{site.konnect_short_name}}?
    a: |
      Because Kubernetes resources are the source of truth for configuring {{ site.base_gateway }} in Kubernetes, the KIC instance configuration in {{site.konnect_short_name}} is marked as read-only. This prevents configuration drift in {{ site.base_gateway }} caused by changes made outside the Ingress or Kubernetes Gateway API.

      For example, if a Route is created via the Kubernetes Gateway API and then modified in {{site.base_gateway}}, those changes wouldn't be reflected in the CRD and would conflict with the desired state defined in the CRD.

The {{site.kic_product_name}} configures {{site.base_gateway}} using Ingress or [Gateway API](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/) resources created inside a Kubernetes cluster.

{{site.kic_product_name}} enables you to configure plugins, load balance the services, check the health of the Pods, and leverage all that Kong offers in a standalone installation.

{:.info}
> The {{ site.kic_product_name }} does not proxy any traffic directly. It configures {{ site.base_gateway }} using Kubernetes resources.

The figure illustrates how {{site.kic_product_name}} works:

The Controller listens for changes inside the Kubernetes cluster and dynamically updates {{site.base_gateway}} in response to those changes. 
In this setup, {{site.base_gateway}} can respond to changes around scaling, configuration, and failures that occur inside a Kubernetes cluster in real time.

For more information on how {{site.base_gateway}} works with Routes, Gateway Services, and Upstreams,
please see the [proxy](/gateway/traffic-control/proxying/) and [load balancing](/gateway/load-balancing/) documentation.

## Kubernetes resources

In Kubernetes, there are several concepts that are used to logically identify workloads and route traffic between them.

### Service / Pods

A [Service](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/) inside Kubernetes is a way to abstract an application that is running on a set of Pods. This maps to two objects in {{site.base_gateway}}: Gateway Service and Upstream.

The Gateway Service object in {{site.base_gateway}} holds the information of the protocol needed to talk to the upstream service and various other protocol-specific settings. The Upstream object defines load balancing and health-checking behavior.

Each Kubernetes Service is defined as an Upstream in {{site.base_gateway}}. Each Pod associated with the Kubernetes Service is added as a Target within the Upstream. {{site.base_gateway}} load balances across the Pods of your service. This means that **all requests flowing through {{site.base_gateway}} are not directed through kube-proxy but directly to the Pod**.


### Gateway API

Gateway API resources can also be used to produce running instances and configurations for {{site.base_gateway}}.

The main concepts of the Gateway API are:

- A [Gateway](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/concepts/api-overview/#gateway) resource in Kubernetes describes how traffic
  can be translated to services within the cluster.
- A [GatewayClass](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/concepts/api-overview/#gatewayclass) defines a set of Gateways that share
  a common configuration and behaviour.
  Each GatewayClass is handled by a single controller, although controllers
  may handle more than one GatewayClass.
- [HTTPRoute](/kubernetes-ingress-controller/routing/http/) can be attached to a Gateway which
  configures the HTTP routing behavior.

For more information about Gateway API resources and features supported by {{site.kic_product_name}}, see
[Gateway API](/kubernetes-ingress-controller/gateway-api).


### Ingress

An [Ingress](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/) resource in Kubernetes defines a set of rules for proxying traffic. These rules correspond to the concept of a Route in {{site.base_gateway}}.

The following diagram describes the relationship between Kubernetes concepts and Kong's Ingress configuration. The colored boxes represent Kong concepts, and the outer boxes represent Kubernetes concepts.
