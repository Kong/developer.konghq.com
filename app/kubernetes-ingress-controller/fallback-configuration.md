{{site.kic_product_name}} 3.2.0 introduced the Fallback Configuration feature. It is designed to isolate issues related to individual parts of the configuration, allowing updates to the rest of it to proceed with no interruption. If you're using {{site.kic_product_name}} in a multi-team environment, the fallback configuration mechanism can help you avoid lock-ups when one team's
configuration is broken.

> **Note:** Fallback Configuration is an opt-in feature. You must enable it by setting `FallbackConfiguration=true` in the controller's feature gates configuration. See [Feature Gates](/kubernetes-ingress-controller/reference/feature-gates) to learn how to do that.

## How fallback configuration works

{{site.kic_product_name}} translates Kubernetes objects it gets from the Kubernetes API and pushes the translation result via {{site.base_gateway}}â€™s Admin API to {{site.base_gateway}} instances. However, issues can arise at various stages of this process:

1. Admission Webhook: Validates individual Kubernetes objects against schemas and basic rules.
2. Translation Process: Detects issues like cross-object validation errors.
3. {{site.base_gateway}} Response: {{site.base_gateway}} rejects the configuration and returns an error associated with a specific object.

Fallback Configuration is triggered when an issue is detected in the 3rd stage and provides the following benefits:
- Allows unaffected objects to be updated even when there are configuration errors.
- Automatically builds a fallback configuration that {{site.base_gateway}} will accept without requiring user intervention by
  either:
  - Excluding the broken objects along with its dependants.
  - Backfilling the broken object along with its dependants using the last valid Kubernetes objects' in-memory cache (if `CONTROLLER_USE_LAST_VALID_CONFIG_FOR_FALLBACK` environment variable is set to `true`).
- Enables users to inspect and identify what objects were excluded from or backfilled in the configuration using
  diagnostic endpoints.

The following table summarizes the behavior of the Fallback Configuration feature based on the configuration:

{% table %}
columns:
  - title: "`FallbackConfiguration` feature gate value"
    key: gate
  - title: "`CONTROLLER_USE_LAST_VALID_CONFIG_FOR_FALLBACK` value"

    key: behavior
rows:
  - gate: "`false`"

    behavior: "The last valid configuration is used as a whole to recover (if stored)."
  - gate: "`true`"
    flag: "`false`"
    behavior: "The Fallback Configuration is triggered, broken objects and their dependents are excluded."
  - gate: "`true`"
    flag: "`true`"
    behavior: "The Fallback Configuration is triggered, broken objects and their dependents are excluded and backfilled with their last valid version (if stored)."
{% endtable %}

### Inspecting the fallback configuration process

Each time {{site.kic_product_name}} successfully applies a fallback configuration, it emits a Kubernetes Event with the `FallbackKongConfigurationSucceeded` reason. It will also emit an Event with the `FallbackKongConfigurationApplyFailed` reason in case the fallback configuration gets rejected by {{site.base_gateway}}. You can monitor these events to track the fallback configuration process.

You can check to see if the Event is emitted by running:

```bash
kubectl get events -A --field-selector='reason=FallbackKongConfigurationSucceeded'
```

The results should look like this:
```text
NAMESPACE   LAST SEEN   TYPE     REASON                               OBJECT                                 MESSAGE
kong        4m26s       Normal   FallbackKongConfigurationSucceeded   pod/kong-controller-7f4fd47bb7-zdktb   successfully applied fallback Kong configuration to https://192.168.194.11:8444
```
