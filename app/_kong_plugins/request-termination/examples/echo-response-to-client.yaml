  Block requests and echo the response back to the client with debugging information about the {{site.base_gateway}} instance, 
  such as the matched Route and Gateway Service.

  You can also combine the `config.echo` parameter with a [header name specified in `config.trigger`](/plugins/request-termination/examples/trigger-on-header/)
  to make the plugin trigger only on specific requests and avoid disturbing real traffic.
