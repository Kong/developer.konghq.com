title: Limit query cost
description: |
  Define a maximum cost applied to any query, regardless of whether or not the call is within the rate limits for a consumer.

  By defining a `max_cost` on the upstream service, you ensure that no query will run with a cost higher than the set `max_cost`. 
  By default it's set to 0, which means no limit.

requirements: 
  - You have an existing a GraphQL upstream service.
