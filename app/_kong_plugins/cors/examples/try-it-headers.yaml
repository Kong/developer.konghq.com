  Configures the CORS plugin to support sending requests with any headers from the Dev Portal spec renderer. 
  You must use this configuration if the Routes associated with your API specs use any headers, including custom headers.

requirements: 
- "If the Routes associated with your API specs use any headers, add [`methods: OPTIONS`](/gateway/entities/route/#schema-route-methods) to any Routes that use the headers."
- "If the Routes associated with your API specs require custom headers to match (the request has to be made with the specified header, otherwise the request will be a 404), configure one of the following:
  * Add a new Route at the same path with [`methods: OPTIONS`](/gateway/entities/route/#schema-route-methods) configured 
  * Add a global Route at the Control Plane-level with [`methods: OPTIONS`](/gateway/entities/route/#schema-route-methods) configured (no path needs to be specified)"
