The Redirect plugin allows you to stop request execution and return a `Location` header to the caller to redirect them to a new URL.

You can keep the incoming request URL while redirecting to a new host or port by setting [`config.keep_incoming_path`](./reference/#schema--config-keep-incoming-path) to `true`.
