extended_description: |
    You can use `uri_captures` to capture the URI of the request and use it as the message destination name.

    For example, if you have a Route that looks like this: 

    ```sh
    ~/demo/(?topic_id_1\w+)/hello/(?topic_id_2\w+)`
    ```

    You can use the following configuration:
    ```yaml
    name: /topic/$(uri_captures['topic_id_1'])/test/$(uri_captures['topic_id_2'])
    ```
    If the request doesn't match, the plugin will remove the placeholder and the `/`, so the final destination will be `/topic/test/`.

    {:.info}
    > **Note:** Use single quotes for the topic ID, such as `$(uri_captures['topic_id_1']`. Double quotes will cause errors.
