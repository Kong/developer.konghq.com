The Salt Security Kong deployment is used to capture a mirror of application traffic and send it to the Salt Security Service for analysis.
This plugin has low CPU and memory consumption and adds no latency to the application since it doesn't sit in line with the production traffic.
The plugin needs to see unencrypted traffic (after SSL termination) to enable the Salt Security service to perform analysis.
