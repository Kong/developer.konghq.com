  Use internal auth within your ecosystem to inject request headers before proxying a request.

  This example contains the following nodes:
  1. The node `STATIC_INPUTS` sets some static values that will be used as inputs to other nodes.
  2. The node `BUILD_HEADERS` fetches an API key from the client query and injects it into the request headers that will be sent to the auth service.
  3. The node `AUTH_REQUEST` makes a POST request to the auth service.
  4. The node `UPSTREAM_AUTH_HEADER` composes an Authorization header from the access token received from the auth service and 
  adds it to the service request headers before proxying the request.
