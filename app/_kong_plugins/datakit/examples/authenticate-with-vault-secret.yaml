  Authenticate to a third-party service using Vault secrets.

extended_description: |
  Authenticate to a third-party service using Vault secrets. Refer to the [Vault documentation](/gateway/entities/vault/) for more information on how to set up and use Vault secrets.

  This example contains the following nodes:
  1. The node `STATIC_INPUTS` sets some static values that will be used as inputs to other nodes.
  2. The node `BUILD_HEADERS` fetches an API key from a Vault reference and injects it into the request headers that will be sent to the auth service.
  3. The node `AUTH_REQUEST` makes a POST request to the auth service.
  4. The node `UPSTREAM_AUTH_HEADER` composes an Authorization header from the access token received from the auth service and 
  adds it to the service request headers before proxying the request.
