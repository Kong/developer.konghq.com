  Use the Datakit plugin to dynamically adjust request headers before passing them to a third-party service.

  This example contains the following nodes:
  1. The node `HEADERS` sets some additional headers to add to the API call.
  2. The node `MERGE_HEADERS` creates a new header map, prefixing each request header with `X-Request-` and merging in the static headers from `HEADERS`.
  3. The node `API` sends the updated request headers to an external API.
  4. The node `EXIT` sends a response to the client with the API headers and body.
