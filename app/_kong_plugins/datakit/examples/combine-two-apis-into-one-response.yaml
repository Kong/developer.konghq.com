  Make requests to multiple APIs and combine their responses into one response.

  This example contains the following nodes:
  1. The node `CAT_FACT` makes a `GET` request to the cat facts API at `https://catfact.ninja/fact`.
  2. The node `DOG_FACT` makes a `GET` request to the dog facts API at `https://dogapi.dog/api/v1/facts`.
  3. The node `JOIN` combines the JSON response bodies of `CAT_FACT` and `DOG_FACT` into a single JSON object.
  4. The node `EXIT` sends a response to the client with the combined API response data. 
  This terminates the request instead of proxying it upstream.
