  Make requests to multiple APIs and combine their responses into one response.

  This example contains the following nodes:
  1. The node `AUTHOR` makes a `GET` request to the API at `https://httpbin.konghq.com/json`.
  2. The node `UUID` makes a `GET` request to the API at `https://httpbin.konghq.com/uuid`.
  3. The node `JOIN` combines the JSON response bodies of `AUTHOR` and `UUID` into a single JSON object.
  4. The node `EXIT` sends a response to the client with the combined API response data. 
  This terminates the request instead of proxying it upstream.
