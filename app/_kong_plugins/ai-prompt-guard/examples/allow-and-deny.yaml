description: Use the AI Prompt Guard plugin to allow general IT questions and block prompts related to hacking, phishing, or inappropriate use.
extended_description: |
  This configuration sets up the AI Prompt Guard plugin to semantically filter incoming requests based on pattern matching.

  In this example:

  * Requests are **allowed** if they match common IT-related question formats like "what is", "how do I", or "install".
  * Requests are **denied** if they contain sensitive or inappropriate terms such as "hack", "phish", "malware", or "cve".
   
   For a complete tutorial on this example, see [Use AI Prompt Guard plugin to govern your LLM traffic](/how-to/use-ai-prompt-guard-plugin/).
