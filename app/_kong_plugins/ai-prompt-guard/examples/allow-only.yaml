extended_description: |
  Configure the plugin to allow messages following a specific pattern. 
  For requests to pass through in this example, 
  any of the user role messages in the prompt must have all card fields adhering to this standard:
  starts with the integer 4, then 3 integers, then 12 asterisks.

  This plugin would prevent accidental processing and/or subsequent model training when full card numbers are sent in.
