description: 'The ACE plugin only engages with a request when it matches an operation.'

extended_description: |
  The ACE plugin only engages with a request when it matches an operation. 
  If a request doesn't match, ACE lets the request pass through untouched. 
  This means that non-matching requests aren't rejected, but ACE also won't perform authentication and authorization on them. 
  This allows a request to still be processed by other plugins with a [lower priority](/gateway/entities/plugin/#plugin-priority) than ACE.  
  
  A limitation of this method is that all traffic outside of APIs linked to an ACE-enabled {{site.base_gateway}} won't be access controlled, this must be configured with a different plugin. 
  Dev Portal will not be able to protect all operations.

  Use cases:
  * You have an environment where some Gateway Services or Routes are governed by Dev Portal–exposed APIs (with ACE), while others are regular Routes that should be left alone.
  * You already have existing traffic and other access controls in place and want to avoid interruption.
