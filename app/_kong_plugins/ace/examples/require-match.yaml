extended_description: |
  Requires every incoming request to match a defined operation from an API or API package in Dev Portal. 
  If a request doesn't match, ACE rejects the request outright with a 404. 
  All traffic will be rejected except operations or Routes in published APIs linked to an ACE-enabled {{site.base_gateway}}. 

  {:.danger}
  > **Warning:** Setting the `match_policy` to `required` can **block all traffic with a 404**. Any undefined endpoints will be blocked. If you accidentally enable this in your control planes, this could cause a potential outage in production.
