  Configure the anonymous Consumer to allow anonymous access or multi-authentication.

  When setting the `anonymous` config, there are two outcomes to be aware of:

  * Requests that have authenticated with another, higher priority authentication plugin will bypass the ACE plugin, removing the requirement to authenticate as a portal application and be authorized for the given operation.
  * Requests that don't authenticate as a Dev Portal application or another authenticated credential will be allowed to pass through the ACE plugin, opening access to all traffic. If this outcome is not desired, a [`request-termination`](/plugins/request-termination/) or similar plugin must be applied to the anonymous consumer, ensuring that unauthenticated access is not allowed.
