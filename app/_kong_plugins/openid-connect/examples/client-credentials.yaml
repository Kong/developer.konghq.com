  Configure the OpenID Connect plugin with the client credentials grant. 

  Here's how the client credentials grant works:

  {% include_cached plugins/oidc/diagrams/client-credentials.md %}
  
  In this example, the plugin will only accept client credentials sent in a header, 
  but you can also set the `client_credentials_param_type` parameter to `body`, `query`, or any combination of these values.

  For a complete example of authenticating with client credentials using Keycloak, see the tutorial for [configuring OpenID Connect with the client credentials grant](/how-to/configure-oidc-with-client-credentials/).

  {% include_cached plugins/oidc/client-auth.md %}
