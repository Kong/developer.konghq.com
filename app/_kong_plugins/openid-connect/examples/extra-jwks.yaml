title: Token validation for multiple IdPs
description: |
  Configure the OpenID Connect plugin to validate JWTs issued by multiple IdPs.
extended_description: |
  You can verify tokens issued by multiple IdP using the [`extra_jwks_uris`](/plugins/openid-connect/reference/#schema--config-extra-jwks-uris) configuration option, with the following considerations:

  * Since the plugin only accepts a single issuer, any `iss` claim verification will fail for tokens that come from a different IdP than the one that was used in the issuer configuration option. Add all issuers as they appear in the `iss` claims of your tokens to the [`config.issuers_allowed`](/plugins/openid-connect/reference/#schema--config-issuers-allowed) setting.
  * If you make any changes to the `extra_jwks_uris` value, you have to clear the second level DB cache for the change to become effective.
  See [Delete a Discovery Cache Object](/plugins/openid-connect/api/#/operations/deleteDiscoveryCache).

  This example shows how to configure two different `extra_jwks_uris` to support token validation for two different IdPs.
