  Configure the OpenID Connect plugin to use the refresh token grant.

  Here's how refresh token grant auth works:

  {% include_cached plugins/oidc/diagrams/refresh-token.md %}

  In this example, the OpenID Connect plugin will only accept refresh tokens sent in a header, 
  but you can also set the `refresh_token_param_type` parameter to `body`, `query`, or any combination of these values.

  For a complete example of authenticating with a refresh token using Keycloak, see the tutorial for [configuring OpenID Connect with the refresh token grant](/how-to/configure-oidc-with-refresh-token/).
