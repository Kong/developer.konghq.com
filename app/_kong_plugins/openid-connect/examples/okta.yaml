title: OpenID Connect with Okta
description: |
  Authenticate browser clients using [Okta](https://help.okta.com/en-us/content/index.htm).

  The following configuration example allows users to authenticate and access the upstream service even though no Consumer was created for them. 
  This means any user with a valid account in the directory will have access.
  If you want to restrict access further, you have several options:
  
  * **Consumer mapping**: If you need to interact with other {{site.base_gateway}} plugins using consumer information, you can map account data received from the IdP to a Kong Consumer. 
  See [OIDC with Consumer authorization](/how-to/configure-oidc-with-consumers/).
  * **Pseudo-consumer mapping**: For plugins that typically require Consumers, the OIDC plugin can provide a Consumer ID based on the value of a claim without mapping to an actual Consumer. 
  Setting `credential_claim` to a claim in your plugin configuration extracts the value of that claim and uses it where {{site.base_gateway}} would normally use a Consumer ID. 
  Similarly, setting `authenticated_groups_claim` extracts that claim's value and uses it as a group for the [ACL plugin](/plugins/acl/).
