title: JWT access token authentication
description: |
  Configure the OpenID Connect plugin with JWT access token authentication.

  In this example, the plugin will only accept a bearer token sent in a query string, 
  but you can also set the `bearer_token_param_type` parameter to `body`, `header`, or any combination of these values.
  
  For a complete example of authenticating with a JWT access token using Keycloak, see the tutorial for [configuring OpenID Connect with JWT authentication](/how-to/configure-oidc-with-jwt-auth/).
