  Authenticate headless service consumers using Auth0's identity provider.
extended_description: |
  Authenticate headless service consumers using [Auth0's identity provider](https://auth0.com/docs/authenticate/identity-providers).

  This example uses a client credentials grant as it is non-interactive, 
  and because we expect clients to authenticate on behalf of themselves, not an end-user. 

weight: 799
requirements:
  - "Auth0 API configured with the `openid` scope. Find your `issuer` URL and `audience`
    in your Auth0 API configuration."
  - "Your client is authorized to access your API. 
    After client creation in Auth0, set the client to Authorized, expand its authorization settings, and enable the `openid` scope."
  - "A [Gateway Service](/gateway/entities/service/) with the `url` configured to match your Auth0 API Identifier."

config:
  issuer: ${issuer}
  audience: 
  - ${audience}
  auth_methods:
  - client_credentials

variables:
  issuer:
    value: $ISSUER
    description: |
      The issuer authentication URL for your IdP. 
      For Auth0, that typically looks like this: `https://$AUTH0_API_NAME.auth0.com/.well-known/openid-configuration`.
  audience:
    value: $AUTH0_API_IDENTIFIER
    description: Auth0's token endpoint requires [passing the API identifier in the audience parameter](https://auth0.com/docs/api/authentication#client-credentials), which must be added as a custom argument.
