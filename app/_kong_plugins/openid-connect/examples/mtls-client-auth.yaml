title: Mutual TLS client authentication
description: |
  Configure the OpenID Connect plugin to use [mutual TLS (mTLS) client authentication](/plugins/openid-connect/#mutual-tls-client-authentication).

  The following uses the password grant, but you can use any supported OpenID Connect auth method.

  The configuration option `config.tls_client_auth_ssl_verify` controls whether the server (IdP) certificate is verified.
  When set to `true` (default), ensure that [trusted certificate](/gateway/configuration/#lua-ssl-trusted-certificate) and [verify depth](/gateway/configuration/#lua-ssl-verify-depth) are appropriately configured so that the IdP's server certificate is trusted by {{site.base_gateway}}.
