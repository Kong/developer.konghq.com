title: Introspection authentication
description: |
  Configure the OpenID Connect plugin with introspection authentication.

  In this example, the plugin will only accept a bearer token sent in a header, 
  but you can also set the `bearer_token_param_type` parameter to `body`, `query`, or any combination of these values.
  
  For a complete example of authenticating with a token retrieved through Keycloak's introspection endpoint, see the tutorial for [configuring OpenID Connect with introspection](/how-to/configure-oidc-with-introspection/).
