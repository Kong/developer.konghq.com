title: Password grant
description: |
  Configure the OpenID Connect plugin to use the password grant.

  {:.info}
  > This is a legacy authentication grant, as it's less secure than other flows.

  In this example, the OpenID Connect plugin will only accept the password sent in a header, 
  but you can also set the `bearer_token_param_type` parameter to `body`, `query`, `cookie`, or any combination of these values.
