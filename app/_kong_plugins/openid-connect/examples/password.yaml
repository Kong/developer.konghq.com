  Configure the OpenID Connect plugin to use the password grant.

  {:.info}
  > This is a legacy authentication grant, as it's less secure than other flows.

  In this example, the OpenID Connect plugin will only accept the password sent in a header, 
  but you can also set the [`config.bearer_token_param_type`](/plugins/openid-connect/reference/#schema--config-bearer-token-param-type) parameter to `body`, `query`, `cookie`, or any combination of these values.

  We're also passing the client secret in the body of the request. 
  You can pass the secret in more secure ways by using a different [`config.client_auth`](/plugins/openid-connect/reference/#schema--config-client-auth) option.

  For a complete example of authenticating with a username and password pair using Keycloak, see the tutorial for [configuring OpenID Connect with the password grant](/how-to/configure-oidc-with-password-grant/).
