extended_description: |
  Configure the OpenID Connect plugin to use user info authentication.

  In this example, the OpenID Connect plugin will only accept bearer tokens sent in a header, 
  but you can also set the `bearer_token_param_type` parameter to `body`, `query`, or any combination of these values.

  For a complete example of authenticating with a token retrieved through Keycloak's user info endpoint, see the tutorial for [configuring OpenID Connect with user info](/how-to/configure-oidc-with-user-info-auth/).
