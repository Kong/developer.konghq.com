title: OpenID Connect with Curity
description: |
  Integrate Kong Gateway and the Curity Identity Server for introspection using the
  [Phantom Token pattern](https://curity.io/resources/learn/phantom-token-pattern).

  The OpenID Connect plugin introspects an incoming opaque access token and receives a JWT in the introspection response from the Curity Identity Server. 
  As part of the introspection, the OpenID Connect plugin validates that required scopes are available in the introspected token. 
  * If the correct scopes are missing, access to the requested upstream service is denied.
  * If access is granted, the JWT from the introspection response is added to a header and forwarded to the upstream service where it can be consumed.
