This plugin converts requests into [Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/) messages and publishes them to a specified Kafka topic.  
For more details, see [Kafka topics](https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#intro_concepts_and_terms).

{{site.base_gateway}} also offers a separate [Kafka Log](/plugins/kafka-log/) plugin for streaming logs to Kafka topics.

## Implementation details

This plugin uses the [lua-resty-kafka](https://github.com/kong/lua-resty-kafka) client.

When encoding request bodies, several things happen:

* For requests with a content-type header of `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`, `multipart/form-data`,
  or `application/json`, this plugin passes the raw request body in the `body` attribute, and tries
  to return a parsed version of those arguments in `body_args`. If this parsing fails, an error message is
  returned and the message is not sent.
* If the `content-type` is not `text/plain`, `text/html`, `application/xml`, `text/xml`, or `application/soap+xml`,
  then the body will be base64-encoded to ensure that the message can be sent as JSON. In such a case,
  the message has an extra attribute called `body_base64` set to `true`.

Known limitations:

1. Message compression is not supported.
1. In {{site.base_gateway}} 3.9 or earlier, the message format is not customizable.
