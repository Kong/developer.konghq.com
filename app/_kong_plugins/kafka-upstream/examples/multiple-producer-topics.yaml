  Starting in {{site.base_gateway}} 3.10, the Kafka Upstream plugin supports sending messages to multiple client-defined Kafka topics by using a query parameter that contains a list of target topic names. 
  To prevent client requests from sending messages to arbitrary topics, you can also define a topic allowlist.
  A client can use the `topic-list` query argument to send the message to multiple topics, including any topics in the  `allowed_topic` list, as well as the default topic defined in the `topic` field:
  `curl 'http://localhost:8000/kafka?topic-list=my-topic,topic1'`
