  As of {{site.base_gateway}} 3.10, the Kafka Upstream plugin supports sending messages to multiple Kafka topics specified by the client through a query parameter. 
  To control which topics clients can target, you can configure an allowlist of permitted topic names.
  
  Clients can use the `topic-list` query parameter to send a message to one or more topics. These can include topics listed in the `allowed_topic` configuration, as well as the default topic specified in the `topic` field.

  Example:
  `curl http://localhost:8000/kafka?topic-list=my-topic,topic1`
