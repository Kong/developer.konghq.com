The Kong Spec Expose plugin lets you expose an OpenAPI Spec (OAS), Swagger, or other specification of auth-protected upstream services fronted using {{site.base_gateway}}.

## How it works

API providers need a means of exposing the specifications of their services while maintaining authentication on the service itself.
The Kong Spec Expose plugin solves this problem by doing the following:

1. The plugin enables a Kong Admin to specify the endpoint of their API specification.
2. The plugin validates that the proxy request is a `GET` method, and will validate the proxy request ends with `/specz`. If these two requirements are met, the endpoint returns the specification of the upstream service with Content-Type header identical to what the upstream service exposes.
