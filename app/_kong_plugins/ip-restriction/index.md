## Overview

The IP Restriction plugin restricts access to a Gateway Service or a Route by either allowing or denying IP addresses. This can help block malicious activity, such as spam or access to certain websites. Single IPs, multiple IPs, or ranges in [Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) notation](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4632) like 10.10.10.0/24 can be used. The plugin supports IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.

You can configure the plugin with an `allow` list of IP addresses or ranges to allow and a `deny` list of IP addresses or ranges to reject. When only an `allow` list is configured, all IP addresses that aren't on that list are rejected. Similarly, when only a `deny` list is configured, all IP addresses that aren't on the `deny` list are accepted. 

You can configure the plugin with both an `allow` and `deny` list. This can be useful if you want to allow a CIDR range but deny an IP address on that CIDR range.

## How is the IP address determined?

The IP address is determined by the request header sent to {{site.base_gateway}} from downstream. In most cases, the header has the name `X-Real-IP` or `X-Forwarded-For`.

By default, {{site.base_gateway}} uses the header name `X-Real-IP`. If a different header name is required, it needs to be defined using the `real_ip_header` property in [`kong.conf`](/gateway/configuration/). Depending on the network setup, the `trusted_ips` property may also need to be configured to include the load balancer IP address.
