The LDAP Authentication Advanced plugin
provides features not available in the [LDAP Authentication plugin](/plugins/ldap-auth/), including:
* LDAP searches for group and Consumer mapping
* Authentication of Consumers based on username or custom ID
* Binding to an enterprise LDAP directory with a password
* Authentication/authorization using a group base DN and specific group member or group name attributes
* Obtaining LDAP groups and setting them in a request header before proxying to the upstream. This is useful for [Kong Manager](/gateway/kong-manager/) role mapping.

## Usage

{% include /plugins/ldap/usage.md %}

### Upstream headers

{% include_cached /plugins/upstream-headers.md %}

### LDAP search and `config.bind_dn`

LDAP directory searching is performed during the request and plugin lifecycle to retrieve the fully qualified DN of the user. 
This allows the plugin to bind using the user's LDAP username and password.
The search uses:

* `scope="sub"`

* `filter="<attribute>=<username>"`

* `base_dn=<base_dn>`
Here is an example of how it performs the search using the `ldapsearch` command line utility:

```bash
ldapsearch -x \
  -h "$LDAP_HOST" \
  -D "$BIND_DN" \
  -b "$ATTRIBUTE=$USERNAME,$BASE_DN" \
  -w "$LDAP_PASSWORD"
```

### Using service directory mapping on the CLI

{% include /plugins/ldap/service-directory-mapping.md %}

## LDAP groups

The plugin obtains LDAP groups and sets them in the `x-authenticated-groups` request header before proxying to the upstream. 
This is useful for Kong Manager role mapping.

{:.info}
> The plugin doesn’t authenticate users based on group membership. If the user is not a member of an LDAP group, the request is still allowed.

## Limitations

* The `config.group_base_dn` and `config.base_dn` parameters have to fully match the exact DN of the group, 
a generic DN won’t work. 
For example, consider a case where there are nested organizational units. If a
top-level DN such as `"ou=dev,o=company"` is specified instead of
`"ou=role,ou=groups,ou=dev,o=company"`, the authentication will fail.

* Referrals aren't supported in the plugin. A workaround is
to hit the LDAP Global Catalog instead, which is usually listening on a
different port than the default `389`. That way, referrals don't get sent
back to the plugin.
