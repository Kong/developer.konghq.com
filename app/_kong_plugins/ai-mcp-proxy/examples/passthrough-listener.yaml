extended_description: |
  Configure AI Gateway passthrough for existing MCP Servers to enable proxying and observability.

  {:.warning}
  > For this configuration to work properly, you need a [Service](/gateway/entities/service/#set-up-a-gateway-service) and a [Route](/gateway/entities/route/#set-up-a-route) with the following configuration:
  > ```yaml
  > services:
  > - name: mcp-service
  >   url: http://host.docker.internal:3000
  >   routes:
  >   - name: mcp-route
  >     paths:
  >     - /marketplace
  > ```

  Before using the [AI MCP Proxy](/plugins/ai-mcp-proxy/) plugin, youâ€™ll need an upstream HTTP API to expose.
  Use this mock API to test the plugin without relying on an external service; it simulates a small marketplace with sample users and orders exposed through `/marketplace/users` and `/marketplace/{userId}/orders` endpoints:

  ```bash
  curl -s -o api.js "https://gist.githubusercontent.com/subnetmarco/5ddb23876f9ce7165df17f9216f75cce/raw/a44a947d69e6f597465050cc595b6abf4db2fbea/api.js"
  npm install express
  node api.js
  ```
