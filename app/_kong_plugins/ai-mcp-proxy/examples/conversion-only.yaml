  Define reusable MCP tool specifications without serving them.

  AI MCP Proxy plugins running in conversion-only mode don't serve requests themselves. They must be paired with a `listener` plugin that references their tags. See the [listener](/plugins/ai-mcp-proxy/examples/conversion-only/) example for details.

  {:.info}
  > For this configuration to work properly, you need a [Service](/gateway/entities/service/#set-up-a-gateway-service) and a [Route](/gateway/entities/route/#set-up-a-route) with the following configuration:
  > ```yaml
  > services:
  > - name: mcp-service
  >   url: http://host.docker.internal:3000
  >   routes:
  >   - name: mcp-route
  >     paths:
  >     - /marketplace
  > ```

  Before using the [AI MCP Proxy](/plugins/ai-mcp-proxy/) plugin, you’ll need an upstream HTTP API to expose.
  Use this mock API to test the plugin without relying on an external service; it simulates a small marketplace with sample users and orders exposed through `/marketplace/users` and `/marketplace/{userId}/orders` endpoints:

  ```bash
  curl -s -o api.js "https://gist.githubusercontent.com/subnetmarco/5ddb23876f9ce7165df17f9216f75cce/raw/a44a947d69e6f597465050cc595b6abf4db2fbea/api.js"
  npm install express
  node api.js
  ```

  This example uses [`config.tools.annotations.title`](/plugins/ai-mcp-proxy/reference/#schema--config-tools-annotations-title) to add a meaningful name to the tool to simplify human debugging.
