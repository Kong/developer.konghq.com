  Generate an MCP server from {{ site.base_gateway }} Services. 

  {:.warning}
  > For this configuration to work properly, you need a [Service](/gateway/entities/service/#set-up-a-gateway-service) and a [Route](/gateway/entities/route/#set-up-a-route) with the following configuration:
  > ```yaml
  > services:
  > - name: weather-service
  >   url: https://api.weatherapi.com/v1/current.json
  >   routes:
  >   - name: weather-route
  >     paths:
  >     - /weather
  > ```

  This example uses [`config.tools.annotations.title`](/plugins/ai-mcp-proxy/reference/#schema--config-tools-annotations-title) to add a meaningful name to the tool to simplify human debugging.
