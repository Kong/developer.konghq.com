title: 'Configure per-tool access control for passthrough-listener mode MCP servers'

extended_description: |
  Configure consumer groups and key authentication to control access to individual MCP tools based on consumer roles. This configuration applies access control rules at the tool level without a default policy.

  {:.info}
  > For this configuration to work properly, you need to create the following {{site.base_gateway}} entities:
  > ```yaml
  > services:
  >   - name: mcp-acl-service
  >     url: http://host.docker.internal:3001/mcp
  > routes:
  >   - name: mcp-acl-route
  >     paths:
  >       - "/mcp"
  >     service:
  >       name: mcp-acl-service
  >
  > plugins:
  >   - name: key-auth
  >     route: mcp-acl-route
  >     config:
  >       key_names:
  >         - apikey

  > consumer_groups:
  >   - name: admin
  >   - name: developer
  >   - name: suspended

  > consumers:
  >   - username: alice
  >     groups:

  >   - username: bob
  >     groups:
  >       - name: developer
  >     keyauth_credentials:
  >       - key: bob-key

  >   - username: carol
  >     groups:
  >       - name: suspended
  >     keyauth_credentials:
  >       - key: carol-key

  Before using the [AI MCP Proxy](/plugins/ai-mcp-proxy/) plugin, you'll need an upstream HTTP API to expose.
  Use this mock API to test the plugin without relying on an external service. It simulates a small marketplace with sample users and orders exposed:

  ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/tomek-labuk/marketplace-acl.git && \
    cd marketplace-acl && \
    npm install && \
    npm run build && \
    node dist/server.js
  ```

  {:.warning}
  > The `tools[n].name` fields must match the exact tools name from the upstream MCP server. If the names don't match, the ACL will fail to apply.

  Check [this how-to](/mcp/use-access-controls-for-mcp-tools/) for a detailed walkthrough guide.
