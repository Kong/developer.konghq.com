title: 'Configure consumer groups and key authentication for per-tool MCP access control'

extended_description: |
  Configure consumer groups and key authentication to control access to individual MCP tools based on consumer roles. This configuration applies access control rules at the tool level without a default policy.

  Before using the [AI MCP Proxy](/plugins/ai-mcp-proxy/) plugin, you'll need an upstream HTTP API to expose.
  Use this mock API to test the plugin without relying on an external service. It simulates a small marketplace with sample users and orders exposed through `/marketplace/users` and `/marketplace/{userId}/orders` endpoints:

  ```bash
    curl -s -o api.js "https://gist.githubusercontent.com/subnetmarco/5ddb23876f9ce7165df17f9216f75cce/raw/a44a947d69e6f597465050cc595b6abf4db2fbea/api.js"
    npm install express
    node api.js
  ```
