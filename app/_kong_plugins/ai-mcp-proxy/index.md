The AI MCP Proxy plugin lets you connect any Kong-managed Service to the [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/). It acts as a **protocol bridge**, translating between MCP and HTTP so that MCP-compatible clients can either call existing APIs or interact with upstream MCP servers through Kong.

The plugin’s `mode` parameter controls whether it proxies MCP requests, converts RESTful APIs into MCP tools, or exposes grouped tools as an MCP server. This flexibility allows you to integrate existing HTTP APIs into MCP workflows, front third-party MCP servers with Kong’s policies, or expose multiple tool sets as a managed MCP server.

Because the plugin runs directly on Kong AI Gateway, MCP endpoints are provisioned dynamically on demand. You don’t need to host or scale them separately, and the Kong AI Gateway applies its authentication, traffic control, and observability features to MCP traffic at the same scale it delivers for traditional APIs.

{:.warning}
> **Note:** Unlike other available AI plugins, the AI MCP Proxy plugin is not invoked as part of an LLM request flow.
> Instead, it is registered and executed as a regular plugin, allowing it to capture MCP traffic independently of LLM request flow.
>
> **Do not configure the AI MCP Proxy plugin together with other AI plugins on the same Service or Route**.

## Why use the AI MCP Proxy plugin

The AI MCP Proxy bridges the Kong plugin ecosystem with the MCP world, enabling you to bring all of Kong's traffic management, security, and observability capabilities to MCP endpoints:

    key: example
rows:
  - use_case: Authentication
    example: |
      Apply [OpenID Connect](/plugins/openid-connect/) or the [Key Auth](/plugins/key-auth/) plugin to an MCP Server
  - use_case: Rate limiting
    example: |
      Use [Rate Limiting](/plugins/rate-limiting/) or [Rate Limiting Advanced](/plugins/rate-limiting-advanced) plugins to control MCP request volume
  - use_case: Observability
    example: |
      Add [logging and tracing plugins](/plugins/?category=logging) for full request and response visibility
  - use_case: Traffic control
    example: |
      Apply [request/response transformation plugins](/plugins/?category=transformations) or [ACL policies](/plugins/acl/)

## How it works

The AI MCP Proxy plugin handles MCP requests by converting them into standard HTTP calls and returning the responses in MCP format. The flow works as follows:

1. Accepts MCP protocol requests from a client.
2. Parses the MCP tool call and matches it to an OpenAPI operation.
3. Converts the operation into a standard HTTP request.
4. Sends the request to the upstream Service.
5. Wraps the HTTP response in MCP-compatible format and returns it.

## Prerequisites

{:.warning}
> Before using the AI MCP Proxy plugin, ensure your setup meets these requirements:
> - The upstream Service exposes a valid OpenAPI schema.
> - That Service is configured and accessible in Kong.
> - An MCP-compatible client (such as [Claude](https://claude.ai/), [Cursor](https://cursor.com/), or [LMstudio](https://lmstudio.ai/)) is available to connect to Kong.
> - The Kong AI Gateway instance supports the AI MCP Proxy plugin (is 3.12 or higher).

## Configuration modes

The AI MCP Proxy plugin operates in four modes, controlled by the [`config.mode`](./reference/#schema--config-mode) parameter. Each mode determines how Kong handles MCP requests and whether it converts RESTful APIs into MCP tools.

{% table %}
columns:
  - title: Mode
    key: mode
  - title: Description
    key: description
rows:
  - mode: "`passthrough-listener`"
    description: |
      Listens for incoming MCP requests and proxies them to the `upstream_url` of the Gateway Service.
      Generates MCP observability metrics for traffic, making it suitable for third-party MCP servers hosted by users.
  - mode: "`conversion-listener`"
    description: |
      Converts RESTful API paths into MCP tools **and** accepts incoming MCP requests on the Route path.
      You can define tools directly in the plugin configuration and optionally set a server block.
  - mode: "`conversion-only`"
    description: |
      Converts RESTful API paths into MCP tools but does **not** accept incoming MCP requests.
      This mode requires [`config.server.tag`](./reference/#schema--config-server-tag) in the plugin configuration, but does not define a server.
  - mode: "`listener`"
    description: |
      Similar to `conversion-listener`, but instead of defining its own tools, it binds multiple `conversion-only` tools using the [`config.server.tag`](./reference/#schema--config-server-tag) property.
      `conversion-only` plugins define `tags` at the plugin level, and the listener connects to them to expose the tools on a Route for incoming MCP requests.
