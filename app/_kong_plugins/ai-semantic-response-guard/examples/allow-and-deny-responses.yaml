description: Block or allow LLM responses based on semantic similarity to defined rules.

extended_description: |
  The AI Semantic Response Guard plugin analyzes the full response from an LLM service and filters it
  based on semantic similarity to configured allow or deny patterns.

  Deny rules take precedence over allow rules. Responses matching a deny pattern are blocked,
  even if they also match an allow pattern. Responses not matching any allow pattern are blocked
  when allow rules are set.
