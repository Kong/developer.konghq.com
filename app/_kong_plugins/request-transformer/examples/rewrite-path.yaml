  Configure the plugin to rewrite the request path before proxying it to the upstream app/serverless-gateways/index.md:
  
  This example uses the first capture group from your route in the upstream url.

  * **Route**: `paths: ['/users/(\d+)']`
  * **Incoming request**: `GET /users/123`
  * **Upstream request**: `GET /anything/123`
