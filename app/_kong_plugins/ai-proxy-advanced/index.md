faqs:
  - q: Can I authenticate to Azure AI with Azure Identity?
    a: |
      Yes, if {{site.base_gateway}} is running on Azure, AI Proxy Advanced can detect the designated Managed Identity or User-Assigned Identity of that Azure Compute resource, and use it accordingly.
      In your AI Proxy Advanced configuration, set the following parameters:
      * [`config.auth.azure_use_managed_identity`](./reference/#schema--config-targets-auth-azure-use-managed-identity) to `true` to use an Azure-Assigned Managed Identity.
      * [`config.targets.auth.azure_use_managed_identity`](./reference/#schema--config-targets-auth-azure-use-managed-identity) to `true` and an [`config.targets.auth.azure_client_id`](./reference/#schema--config-targets-auth-azure-client-id) to use a User-Assigned Identity.
  - q: Can I override `config.model.name` by specifying a different model name in the request?
    a: |
      No. The model name must match the one configured in `config.model.name`. If a different model is specified in the request, the plugin returns a 400 error.
  - q: |
      Can I override `temperature`, `top_p`, and `top_k` from the request?
    a: |
      Yes. The values for [`temperature`](./reference/#schema--config-targets-model-options-temperature), [`top_p`](./reference/#schema--config-targets-model-options-top-p), and [`top_k`](./reference/#schema--config-targets-model-options-top-k) in the request take precedence over those set in `config.targets.model.options`.

  - q: How can I set model generation parameters when calling Gemini?
    a: |
      You have several options, depending on the SDK and configuration:

      - Use the **Gemini SDK**:

        1. Set [`llm_format`](./reference/#schema--config-llm-format) to `gemini`.
        1. Use the Gemini provider.
        1. Configure parameters like [`temperature`](./reference/#schema--config-targets-model-options-temperature), [`top_p`](./reference/#schema--config-targets-model-options-top-p), and [`top_k`](./reference/#schema--config-targets-model-options-top-k) on the client side:
            ```python
            model = genai.GenerativeModel(
                'gemini-1.5-flash',
                generation_config=genai.types.GenerationConfig(
                    temperature=0.7,
                    top_p=0.9,
                    top_k=40,
                    max_output_tokens=1024
                )
            )
            ```

      - Use the **OpenAI SDK** with the Gemini provider:
        1. Set [`llm_format`](./reference/#schema--config-llm-format) to `openai`.
        1. You can configure parameters in one of three ways:
          - Configure them in the plugin only.
          - Configure them in the client only.
          - Configure them in both—the client-side values will override plugin config.

  - q: Can I override authentication values from the request?
    a: |
      Yes, but only if [`config.targets.auth.allow_override`](./reference/#schema--config-targets-auth-allow-override) is set to `true` in the plugin configuration.
      When enabled, this allows request-level auth parameters (such as API keys or bearer tokens) to override the static values defined in the plugin.

  - q: What algorithm does `ai-proxy-advanced` use for selecting the lowest latency target?
    a: |
      It uses Kong’s built-in load balancing mechanism with the EWMA (Exponentially Weighted Moving Average) algorithm to dynamically route traffic to the backend with the lowest observed latency.

  - q: What is the duration of the learning phase?
    a: |
      There’s no fixed time window. EWMA continuously updates with every response, giving more weight to recent observations. Older latencies decay over time, but still contribute in smaller proportions.

  - q: How is traffic distributed once a faster model is identified?
    a: |
      The fastest model gets a majority of traffic, but Kong never sends 100% to a single target unless it's the only one available. In practice, the dominant target may receive ~90–99% of traffic, depending on how much better its EWMA score is.

  - q: Does the system continue testing other targets?
    a: |
      Yes. EWMA ensures all targets continue to receive a small amount of traffic. This ongoing probing lets the system adapt if a previously slower model becomes faster later.

  - q: What’s the approximate percentage of traffic sent to non-dominant targets?
    a: |
      While exact percentages vary with latency gaps, less performant targets typically get between 0.1%–5% of traffic, just enough to keep updating their EWMA score for comparison.

## Load balancing

This plugin supports several load-balancing algorithms, similar to those used for Kong upstreams, allowing efficient distribution of requests across different AI models. The supported algorithms include:

<!--vale off-->
{% table %}
columns:
  - title: Algorithm
    key: algorithm
  - title: Description
    key: description
rows:
  - algorithm: "[Consistent-hashing (sticky-session on given header value)](/plugins/ai-proxy-advanced/examples/consistent-hashing/)"
    description: |
      The consistent-hashing algorithm routes requests based on a specified header value (`X-Hashing-Header`). Requests with the same header are repeatedly routed to the same model, enabling sticky sessions for maintaining context or affinity across user interactions.
  - algorithm: "[Lowest-latency](/plugins/ai-proxy-advanced/examples/lowest-latency/)"
    description: |
      The lowest-latency algorithm is based on the response time for each model. It distributes requests to models with the lowest response time.
  - algorithm: "[Lowest-usage](/plugins/ai-proxy-advanced/examples/lowest-usage/)"
    description: |
      The lowest-usage algorithm in AI Proxy Advanced is based on the volume of usage for each model. It balances the load by distributing requests to models with the lowest usage, measured by factors such as:

      * Prompt token counts
      * Response token counts
      * Cost {% new_in 3.10 %}

      Or other resource metrics.
  - algorithm: |
      [Priority group](/plugins/ai-proxy-advanced/examples/priority/) {% new_in 3.10 %}
    description: |
      The priority algorithm routes requests to groups of models based on assigned weights. Higher-weighted groups are preferred, and if all models in a group fail, the plugin falls back to the next group. This allows for reliable failover and cost-aware routing across multiple AI models.
  - algorithm: "[Round-robin (weighted)](/plugins/ai-proxy-advanced/examples/round-robin/)"
    description: |
      The round-robin algorithm distributes requests across models based on their respective weights. For example, if your models `gpt-4`, `gpt-4o-mini`, and `gpt-3` have weights of `70`, `25`, and `5` respectively, they’ll receive approximately 70%, 25%, and 5% of the traffic in turn. Requests are distributed proportionally, independent of usage or latency metrics.
  - algorithm: "[Semantic](/plugins/ai-proxy-advanced/examples/semantic/)"
    description: |
      The semantic algorithm distributes requests to different models based on the similarity between the prompt in the request and the description provided in the model configuration. This allows Kong to automatically select the model that is best suited for the given domain or use case.

## Retry and fallback

The [load balancer](/ai-gateway/load-balancing/) has customizable retries and timeouts for requests, and can redirect a request to a different model in case of failure. This allows you to have a fallback in case one of your targets is unavailable.

For versions {% new_in 3.10 %} this plugin supports fallback across targets with any supported formats.
For versions earlier than 3.10, fallback is not supported across targets with different formats. You can still use multiple providers, but only if the formats are compatible.
For example, load balancers with the following target combinations are supported:
* Different OpenAI models
* OpenAI models and Mistral models with the OpenAI format
* Mistral models with the OLLAMA format and Llama models with the OLLAMA format

{:.info}
> Some errors, such as client errors, result in a failure and don't failover to another target.<br/><br/> {% new_in 3.10 %} To configure failover in addition to network errors, set [`config.balancer.failover_criteria`](/plugins/ai-proxy-advanced/reference/#schema--config-balancer-failover-criteria) to include:
> * Additional HTTP error codes, like `http_429` or `http_502`
> * The `non_idempotent` setting, as most AI services accept POST requests
