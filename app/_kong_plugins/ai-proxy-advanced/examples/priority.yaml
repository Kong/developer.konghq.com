title: 'Priority load balancing'
description: |
  Configure the plugin to use three OpenAI models and create priority groups based on their respective weights.

  In this example, the GPT-4 model and the GPT-4o-mini model form a group, and the GPT-3 model forms another group.

  Since the first group has a weight of 70 and the second one a weight of 25, the plugin will first try to route requests to GPT-4 or GPT-4o-mini.
  If both fail, the plugin will choose the GPT-3 model.
