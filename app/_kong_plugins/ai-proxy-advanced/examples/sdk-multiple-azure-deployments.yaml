  Use separate Routes to map Azure OpenAI SDK requests to specific deployments of GPT-3.5 and GPT-4.

  Using OpenAI SDK with the AI Proxy Advanced plugin, you can configure multiple Routes in {{site.base_gateway}} to represent different Azure OpenAI deployments.
  Each Route maps a unique path segment (such as `azure-gpt-3-5` or `azure-gpt-4`) to the corresponding deployment ID and model name.
  This setup allows you to use a single Azure-compatible OpenAI SDK client to switch between deployments by changing only the base URL.

  For example:

  ```python
  client = OpenAI(
    base_url="http://127.0.0.1:8000/openai/deployments/azure-gpt-3-5"
  )
  ```

  Or:

  ```python
  client = OpenAI(
    base_url="http://127.0.0.1:8000/openai/deployments/azure-gpt-4"
  )
  ```
  {{site.base_gateway}} reads the deployment path, maps it to the appropriate Azure deployment ID and model, and handles authentication automatically.

    {:.warning}
    > For this configuration to work properly, you need a [Route](/gateway/entities/route/#set-up-a-route) with the following configuration:
    > ```
    > routes:
    >  - name: azure-chat-gpt-3-5
    >    paths:
    >      - "~/openai/deployments/azure-gpt-3-5/chat/completions$"
    >    methods:
    >      - POST
    > ```
    > and:
    > ```
    > routes:
    >  - name: azure-chat-gpt-4
    >    paths:
    >      - "~/openai/deployments/azure-gpt-4/chat/completions$"
    >    methods:
    >      - POST
    > ```
