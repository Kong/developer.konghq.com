  Configure a chat route using Azure OpenAI Service with the GPT-4o model.

  To connect to Azure AI, you'll need three values from your Azure OpenAI resource:

  1. **Deployment ID** — The unique name of your deployed model.
     - In the [Azure AI Foundry Portal](https://ai.azure.com/?cid=learnDocs) sidebar, select a resource and go to:
       **Shared Resources > Deployments > Model deployments** and click the deployment name.
     - You can also see the deployment ID in the Azure OpenAI URL when calling the API, for example:
       `https://{AZURE_INSTANCE_NAME}.openai.azure.com/openai/deployments/{AZURE_DEPLOYMENT_ID}/...`

  2. **Instance name** — The name of your Azure OpenAI resource.
     - This is the prefix in your API endpoint URL, for example:
       `https://{AZURE_INSTANCE_NAME}.openai.azure.com`

  3. **API Key** — The key used to authenticate requests to your Azure OpenAI deployment in Azure AI Foundry.
     - In the [Azure AI Foundry Portal](https://ai.azure.com/?cid=learnDocs) sidebar, select a resource and go to:
       **Shared Resources > Deployments > Model deployments**, then click the deployment name.
     - The API key is visible in the **Endpoint** tile.
