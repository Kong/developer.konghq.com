  Configure the Zipkin plugin to ignore incoming headers:
  - No tracing context extraction
  - Injects the tracing context using the formats: `b3`, `datadog` 
  Some header formats specify different trace and span ID sizes. When the tracing context is extracted and injected from/to headers with different ID sizes, the IDs are truncated or left-padded to align with the target format.
