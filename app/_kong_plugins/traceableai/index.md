Traceable's Kong plugin lets Traceable capture a copy of the API traffic, both request and response data, that is flowing through {{site.base_gateway}}. The plugin then forwards the data to a locally running Traceable Module Extension (TME).

Using this data, Traceable is able to create a security posture profile of APIs hosted on Kong.
Based on its findings, the Traceable plugin can also block traffic coming from malicious actors and IPs into {{site.base_gateway}}.

## Install the Traceable plugin

### Prerequisites

The Traceable Kong Plugin requires a Traceable Platform Agent to be deployed in your environment.
For complete deployment instructions of the Traceable Platform Agent, visit the [traceable.ai docs site](https://docs.traceable.ai/docs/k8s).

### Install

Once you have deployed a Traceable Platform Agent, you are ready to install the plugin using the LuaRocks package manager:

1. Install the Traceable plugin:

   ```sh
   luarocks install kong-plugin-traceable
   ```

2. Update your loaded plugins list in {{site.base_gateway}}.

   In your `kong.conf`, append `traceable` to the `plugins` field. Make sure the field is not commented out.

   ```yaml
   plugins = bundled,traceable
   ```

3. Restart {{site.base_gateway}}:

   ```sh
   kong restart
   ```
