notes: |
  This plugin is not available in Konnect, and has limitations in hybrid mode:
  - Konnect automatically encrypts key authentication credentials at rest, so 
  encryption via this plugin is not necessary. 
  Use the regular [Key Auth](/plugins/key-auth/) plugin instead.
  - The time-to-live (ttl) does not work in hybrid mode. This setting
  determines the length of time a credential remains valid.

  gateway: '1.0'

The Key Authentication Encrypted plugin adds encrypted API key authentication to a [Gateway Service](/gateway/entities/service/) or [Route](/gateway/entities/route/).  
[Consumers](/gateway/entities/consumer/) can authenticate by including their API key in a query string, header, or request body.

This plugin extends the functionality of the [Key Authentication](/plugins/key-auth/) plugin by allowing API keys to be stored in encrypted form within the {{site.base_gateway}} datastore.


{:.warning}
> **Important**: Before configuring this plugin, you must [enable {{site.base_gateway}}'s encryption Keyring](/gateway/keyring/#enable-keyring).
