The Key Authentication Encrypted plugin adds encrypted API key authentication to a [Gateway Service](/gateway/entities/service/) or [Route](/gateway/entities/route/).  
[Consumers](/gateway/entities/consumer/) can authenticate by including their API key in a query string, header, or request body.

This plugin extends the functionality of the [Key Authentication](/plugins/key-auth/) plugin by allowing API keys to be stored in encrypted form within the {{site.base_gateway}} datastore.


{:.warning}
> **Important**: Before configuring this plugin, you must [enable {{site.base_gateway}}'s encryption Keyring](/gateway/keyring/#enable-keyring).
