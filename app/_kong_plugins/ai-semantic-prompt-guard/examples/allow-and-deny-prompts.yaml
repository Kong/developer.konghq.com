description: Allow messages about a topic as long as they don't contain information about another topic.

  Allow messages about a topic as long as they don't contain information about another topic.

  For example, only allow questions about DevOps that aren't related to exploiting vulnerabilities.
  Topics on the deny list take precedence over the allowed topics.

  For a detailed walkthrough, see [Use AI Semantic Prompt Guard plugin to govern your LLM traffic](/how-to/use-ai-semantic-prompt-guard-plugin/).

  {:.info}
  > If you use the `text-embedding-ada-002` as an embedding model, you must set a fixed dimension of `1536`, as required by the official model specification. Alternatively, use the `text-embedding-3-small` model, which supports dynamic dimensions and works without specifying a fixed value.
