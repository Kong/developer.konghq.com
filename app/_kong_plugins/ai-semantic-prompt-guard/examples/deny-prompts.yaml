  Only deny messages about a specific topic. For example, only deny messages about exploiting vulnerabilities.

  For a detailed walkthrough, see [Use AI Semantic Prompt Guard plugin to govern your LLM traffic](/how-to/use-ai-semantic-prompt-guard-plugin/).

  {:.info}
  > If you use the `text-embedding-ada-002` as an embedding model, you must set a fixed dimension of `1536`, as required by the official model specification. Alternatively, use the `text-embedding-3-small` model, which supports dynamic dimensions and works without specifying a fixed value.
