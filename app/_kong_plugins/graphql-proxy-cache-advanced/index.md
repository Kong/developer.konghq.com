The GrapQL Proxy Cache Advanced plugin provides a reverse GraphQL proxy cache implementation for {{site.base_gateway}}. 
It caches response entities by GraphQL query or Vary headers.

## How the GraphQL Proxy Cache Advanced plugin works

{% include_cached /plugins/caching/strategies.md name=page.name %}

### Cache key

{{site.base_gateway}} assigns a key to each cache element based on the GraphQL query sent in the HTTP request body.
It returns the cache key associated with a given request in the `X-Cache-Key` response header.

Internally, cache keys are represented as a hexadecimal-encoded MD5 sum of the concatenation of the constituent parts:

```
key = md5(UUID | headers | body)
```
{:.no-copy-code}

`headers` contains the headers defined in [`config.vary_headers`](/plugins/graphql-proxy-cache-advanced/reference/#schema--config-vary-headers), which defaults to `none`.

### Cache status
