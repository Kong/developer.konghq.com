The Pre-Function plugin (also known as Kong Functions, Pre-Plugin) lets
you dynamically run Lua code from {{site.base_gateway}} before other plugins in each phase.

This plugin is part of a pair of serverless plugins. 
If you need to run Lua code _after_ other plugins in each phase, see the [Post-Function](/plugins/post-function/) plugin.
