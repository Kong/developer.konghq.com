The gRPC-Web plugins allows access to a [gRPC](https://grpc.io/) service via the [gRPC-Web protocol](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/doc/PROTOCOL-WEB.md#protocol-differences-vs-grpc-over-http2).
Primarily, this means JavaScript browser applications using the [gRPC-Web](https://github.com/grpc/grpc-web) library.

A service that presents a gRPC API can be used by clients written in many languages,
but the network specifications are oriented primarily to connections within a
data center. gRPC-Web lets you expose the gRPC API to the Internet so
that it can be consumed by browser-based JavaScript applications.

This plugin translates requests and responses between gRPC-Web and
[gRPC](https://github.com/grpc/grpc). The plugin supports both HTTP/1.1
and HTTP/2, over plaintext (HTTP) and TLS (HTTPS) connections.
