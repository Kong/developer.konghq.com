  Configure a chat route using Azure OpenAI Service with the GPT-4o model, and authenticate using an Azure Managed Identity.

  To connect to Azure AI, you'll need two key values from your Azure OpenAI resource:

  1. **Deployment ID** — The unique name of your deployed model.
     - In the Azure Portal, go to:
       **Azure Portal → Azure OpenAI Resource → Model deployments → Deployment name** column.
     - You can also see the deployment ID in the Azure OpenAI URL when calling the API, for example:
       `https://{AZURE_INSTANCE_NAME}.openai.azure.com/openai/deployments/{AZURE_DEPLOYMENT_ID}/...`

  2. **Instance name** — The name of your Azure OpenAI resource.
     - This is the prefix in your API endpoint URL, for example:
       `https://{AZURE_INSTANCE_NAME}.openai.azure.com`
