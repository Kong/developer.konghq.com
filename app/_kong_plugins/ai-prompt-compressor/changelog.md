## Changelog

### {{site.base_gateway}} 3.11.0

* Introduced the new **AI Prompt Compressor** plugin, which allows you compress prompts before they are sent to a Large Language Model (LLM) to reduce token usage costs. It leverages the LLMLingua library to perform intelligent compression while preserving the semantic meaning of the text.
