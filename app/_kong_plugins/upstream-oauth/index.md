The Upstream OAuth plugin allows {{site.base_gateway}} to support OAuth flows between {{site.base_gateway}} and the upstream API.

The plugin supports storing tokens issued by the IdP in different backend formats.

## How it works

The upstream OAuth2 credential flow works similarly to the [client credentials grant](/plugins/openid-connect/examples/client-credentials/) used by the OpenID Connect plugin. If a cached access token isn't found, {{site.base_gateway}} issues a request to the IdP token endpoint to obtain a new token, which is cached, and then passed to the upstream API via a configurable header (`Authorization` by default).

## Authentication methods

This plugin supports the following [authentication methods](/plugins/upstream-oauth/reference/#schema--config-client-auth-method):

* `client_secret_basic`: Send `client_id` and `client_secret` in an `Authorization: Basic` header
* `client_secret_post`: Send `client_id` and `client_secret` as part of the body
* `client_secret_jwt`: Send a JWT signed with the `client_secret` using the client assertion as part of the body

## Caching

The Upstream OAuth plugin caches tokens returned by the IdP.  
Cached entries expire based on the `expires_in` indicated by the IdP in the response to the token endpoint.

Tokens are cached using a hash of all values configured under the [`config.oauth`](/plugins/upstream-oauth/reference/#schema--config-oauth) key.
This means that if two instances of the plugin (for example, configured on different Routes and Gateway Services) use identical values under the `config.oauth` section,
then these will share cached tokens.

### Caching strategies

The plugin supports the following caching [strategies](/plugins/upstream-oauth/reference/#schema--config-cache-strategy):

* `memory`: A locally stored `lua_shared_dict`. The default dictionary, `kong_db_cache`, is also used by other plugins and {{site.base_gateway}} elements to store unrelated database cache entities.
* `redis`: Supports Redis, Redis Cluster, and Redis Sentinel deployments.
