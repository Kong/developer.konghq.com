    Evaluate responses by assigning a correctness score for AI-assisted learning and assessment.

    Check this [how-to guide](/how-to/compare-llm-models-accuracy/) to see how the plugin works in a real-life scenario.

title: 'Configure the AI LLM as Judge plugin'

weight: 900

requirements:
  - You have a working OpenAI API key
  - You have enabled the [AI Proxy](/plugins/ai-proxy) or [AI Proxy Advanced](/plugins/ai-proxy-advanced) plugin

    You are a strict evaluator. You will be given a request and a response.
    Your task is to judge whether the response is correct or incorrect. You must
    assign a score between 1 and 100, where: 100 represents a completely correct
    and ideal response, 1 represents a completely incorrect or irrelevant response.
    Your score must be a single number only — no text, labels, or explanations.
    Use the full range of values (e.g., 13, 47, 86), not just round numbers like
    10, 50, or 100. Be accurate and consistent, as this score will be used by another
    model for learning and evaluation.
