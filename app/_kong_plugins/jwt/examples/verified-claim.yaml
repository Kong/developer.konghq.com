  {{site.base_gateway}} can perform verification on registered claims, as defined in [RFC 7519](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519). To perform verification on a claim, add it to the [`config.claims_to_verify`](/plugins/jwt/reference/#schema--config-claims-to-verify) property.

  The following claims are supported:

  * `exp`: Identifies the expiration time on or after which the JWT must not be accepted for processing.
  * `nbf`: Identifies the time before which the JWT must not be accepted for processing.
