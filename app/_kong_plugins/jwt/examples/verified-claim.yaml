  {{site.base_gateway}} can perform verification on registered claims, as defined in [RFC 7519](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519). To perform verification on a claim, add it to the [`config.claims_to_verify`](/plugins/jwt/reference/#schema--config-claims-to-verify) property.

  The following table shows the supported claims:

  {% table %}
  columns:
    - title: Claim name
      key: claim
    - title: Verification
      key: verification
  rows:
    - claim: "`exp`"
      verification: Identifies the expiration time on or after which the JWT must not be accepted for processing.
    - claim: "`nbf`"
      verification: Identifies the time before which the JWT must not be accepted for processing.
  {% endtable %}
