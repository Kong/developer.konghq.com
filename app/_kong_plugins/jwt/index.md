The JWT plugin lets you verify requests containing HS256 or RS256 signed JSON Web Tokens, as specified in [RFC 7519](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519).

When you enable this plugin, it grants JWT credentials (public and secret keys) to each of your consumers, which must be used to sign their JWTs. You can then pass a token through any of the following:

* A query string parameter
* A cookie
* HTTP request headers

Kong will either proxy the request to your upstream services if the tokenâ€™s signature is verified, or discard the request if not. Kong can also perform verifications on some of the registered claims of RFC 7519 (exp and nbf). If Kong finds multiple tokens that differ - even if they are valid - the request will be rejected to prevent JWT smuggling.

## Using the plugin

To use the plugin, you need to do the following:
1. Create a [Consumer](/gateway/entities/consumer/) and associate one or more JWT credentials (holding the public and private keys used to verify the token) to it. The Consumer represents a developer using the final upstream service.
1. Create a JWT credential for the Consumer, either with the `/consumers/{consumer}/jwt` endpoint or by specifying `jwt_secrets:` for the Consumer in a declarative config file. <!--TODO: link to API for parameters available-->
   
   {:.warning}
   > **Note for decK and {{site.kic_product_name}} users:** The declarative configuration used in decK and the {{site.kic_product_name}} imposes some additional validation requirements that differ from the requirements listed above. Because they cannot rely on defaults and do not implement their own algorithm-specific requirements, all fields other than `rsa_public_key` fields are required.
   > <br/><br/>
   > You should always fill out `key`, `algorithm`, and `secret`. If you use any `RS`, `ES`, or `PS` algorithm, use a dummy value for `secret`. In {{site.base_gateway}} 3.6 or earlier, you use the `RS256` or `ES256` algorithm instead.
1. Sign your JWT following [RFC 7519](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519) standards.
1. Enable the JWT plugin.
1. The JWT can now be included in a request to {{site.base_gateway}}. {{site.base_gateway}} *only* proxies requests that include a valid signature, provided they don't include an invalid verified claim (optionally configured with [`config.claims_to_verify`](/plugins/jwt/reference/#schema--config-claims-to-verify)).

For an end-to-end tutorial on this, see [Authenticate Consumers with JWT](/how-to/authenticate-consumers-jwt/).

## Craft a JWT with public/private keys (RS256 or ES256)

If you want to use RS256 or ES256 to verify your JWTs, then when creating a JWT credential,
select `RS256` or `ES256` as the `algorithm`, and explicitly upload the public key
in the `rsa_public_key` field (including for ES256 signed tokens). For example, `rsa_public_key=@/path/to/public_key.pem`.

When creating the signature, make sure that the header is:

```json
{
    "typ": "JWT",
    "alg": "RS256"
}
```

Secondly, the claims **must** contain the secret's `key` field (this **isn't** your private key used to generate
the token, but just an identifier for this credential) in the configured claim (from [`config.key_claim_name`](/plugins/jwt/reference/#schema--config-key-claim-name)).
That claim is `iss` (issuer field) by default. Set its value to our previously created credential's `key`.
The claims may contain other values. The claim is searched in both the JWT payload and header,
in that order.

```json
{
    "iss": "a36c3049b36249a3c9f8891cb127243c"
}
```

Then, create the signature using your private keys. Using the JWT debugger at
[https://jwt.io](https://jwt.io), set the right header (RS256), the claims (`iss`, etc.), and the
associated public key. Then, append the resulting value in the `Authorization` header, for example:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/{routePath} \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiIxM2Q1ODE0NTcyZTc0YTIyYjFhOWEwMDJmMmQxN2MzNyJ9.uNPTnDZXVShFYUSiii78Q-IAfhnc2ExjarZr_WVhGrHHBLweOBJxGJlAKZQEKE4rVd7D6hCtWSkvAAOu7BU34OnlxtQqB8ArGX58xhpIqHtFUkj882JQ9QD6_v2S2Ad-EmEx5402ge71VWEJ0-jyH2WvfxZ_pD90n5AG5rAbYNAIlm2Ew78q4w4GVSivpletUhcv31-U3GROsa7dl8rYMqx6gyo9oIIDcGoMh3bu8su5kQc5SQBFp1CcA5H8sHGfYs-Et5rCU2A6yKbyXtpHrd1Y9oMrZpEfQdgpLae0AfWRf6JutA9SPhst9-5rn4o3cdUmto_TBGqHsFmVyob8VQ'
```

## Upstream Headers

When a JWT is valid and a Consumer has been authenticated, the plugin appends
some headers to the request before proxying it to the Upstream service
so that you can identify the Consumer in your code:

* `X-Consumer-ID`, the ID of the Consumer on Kong.
* `X-Consumer-Custom-ID`, the `custom_id` of the Consumer (if set).
* `X-Consumer-Username`, the `username` of the Consumer (if set).
* `X-Credential-Identifier`, the identifier of the credential (if set).
* `X-Anonymous-Consumer`, set to `true` when authentication failed, and
   the `anonymous` consumer was set instead.

You can use this information on your side to implement additional logic. You can
use the `X-Consumer-ID` value to query the Kong Admin API and retrieve more information about the Consumer.
