The Kong Splunk Log plugin is a modified version of the [HTTP Log plugin](/plugins/http-log/) 
that has been refactored and tailored to work with Splunk.

We recommend enabling the Splunk Logging plugin at a global level.

## Install the Kong Spec Expose plugin

{% include_cached /plugins/install-third-party.md name=page.name slug=page.slug rock="kong-splunk-log" %}

## Configure the Splunk host

The plugin requires an environment variable `SPLUNK_HOST`. 
This is how we define the `host=""` log field in Splunk:

```bash
export SPLUNK_HOST="example.company.com"
```

Make the environment variable accessible by an Nginx worker by adding this line to your `nginx.conf`:

```
env SPLUNK_HOST;
```
