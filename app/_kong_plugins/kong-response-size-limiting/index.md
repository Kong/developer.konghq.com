The Kong Response Size Limiting plugin blocks upstream responses with a body size that exceeds a specified limit in megabytes.

When a response exceeds the configured size, the client receives an HTTP `413` status code and the message body: `Response size limit exceeded`.

{:.warning}
> **Note**: This plugin enforces limits based on the `Content-Length` header in the upstream response.  
> If the upstream service does not include this header, the plugin cannot enforce the limit and the response will be allowed.
