## Overview

The OPA plugin allows you to forward requests to [Open Policy Agent](https://openpolicyagent.org/) and process the requests only if the authorization policy allows it. 

For example, if a request comes in, the OPA plugin sends the relevant details to the OPA host (`config.opa_host`) specified in the plugin configuration. If OPA approves the request, the request is allowed to proceed. If OPA denies the request, the request is rejected.

## OPA input

When {{site.base_gateway}} forwards a request to OPA, the request data is sent with the following structure:

```json
{
 "input": {
   "request": { # details about the request from client to Kong
     "http": {
       "host": "example.org", # host header used by the client to make the request
       "port": "8000",        # port to which the request was made
       "tls": {},             # TLS details if the request was made on HTTPS and Kong terminated the TLS connection
       "method": "GET",       # HTTP method used in the request
       "scheme": "http",      # protocol used to make the request by the client, this can be either `http` or `https`
       "path": "/foo/bar",    # HTTP path used in the request
       "querystring": {       # Query string in the HTTP request as key-value pairs
         "foo" : "bar",
         "foo2" : "bar2",
       },
       "headers": {           # HTTP headers of the request
         "accept-encoding": "gzip, deflate",
         "connection": "keep-alive",
         "accept": "*\\/*"
       },
       "uri_captures": {      # The regex capture groups captured on the Kong Gateway Route's path field in the current request. Injected only if `include_uri_captures_in_opa_input` is set to `true`.

You can use this structure, along with the [OPA docs](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/policy-language/), as a reference to create your policies. For example, you can use `input.request.http.querystring.page` to refer to a `page` query parameter.

## OPA response

Once OPA is done executing policies, the plugin expects the policy evaluation result as either a boolean or an object. If OPA returns any other format or a status code other than `200 OK`, the plugin will return a `500 Internal Server Error` to the client.

### Boolean response

OPA can return a `true` or `false` result after a policy evaluation. If the input request meets the defined policies, OPA should send a `"result": true` response.  If the request violates the policy, OPA should send a `"result": false` response. In this case, any other fields in the response are ignored.


### Object response

For most use cases, the boolean response should suffice. However, you can configure the policy to return an object if needed. This can be used to inject custom HTTP headers to the request, or to change the HTTP code for rejected requests.

In this case, the OPA response has the following structure:
```json
{
 "result": {
   "allow": <boolean>,
   "status": <HTTP status code>,
   "headers": {
     "<key>": "<value>",
     "<key2>": "<value2>"
   },
   "message": "<value3> or object",
 }
}
```

The only required field in this response is `result.allow`, which accepts a boolean value.

If `result.allow` is `true`, then the key-value pairs in `result.headers` are injected into the request before it's forwarded to the upstream service.

If `result.allow` is set to false, then the key-value pairs in `result.headers` are injected into the response, the response message is set to `result.message`, and the status code of the response is set to `result.status`. If `result.status` is absent, the default `403` status code is sent. If `result.message` is absent, then the default `unauthorized` message is sent.
