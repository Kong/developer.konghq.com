  You can authenticate [consumers that are managed centrally](/gateway/entities/consumer/#centrally-managed-consumers) in {{site.konnect_short_name}} by configuring the `identity_realms` field in the Key Auth plugin. A Data Plane can only reach out to realms in the same region as they are deployed.
  
  `identity_realms` are scoped to the Control Plane by default (`scope: cp`). 
  The order in which you configure the `identity_realms` dictates the priority in which the Data Plane attempts to authenticate the provided API keys.
  See the [realm priority reference](/plugins/key-auth/#identity-realms) for details.
