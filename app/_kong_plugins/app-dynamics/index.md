This plugin integrates {{site.base_gateway}} with the [AppDynamics APM platform](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/products/splunk-appdynamics.html) so that
proxy requests handled by {{site.base_gateway}} can be identified and analyzed in
AppDynamics. 

The plugin reports request and response timestamps and error information to 
the AppDynamics platform to be analyzed in the AppDynamics flow map and correlated 
with other systems participating in handling application API requests.

{:.warning}
> **Important:** Unlike other {{site.base_gateway}} plugins, you must configure the AppDynamics plugin via environment variables. You must also install AppDynamics before using the plugin, and you must enable the plugin in your environment.

## AppDynamics installation prerequisites

Before using the plugin, download and install the AppDynamics C/C++ Application Agent and SDK on [Linux](https://docs.appdynamics.com/appd/23.x/latest/en/application-monitoring/install-app-server-agents/c-c++-sdk/install-the-c-c++-sdk-on-linux) or [Windows](https://docs.appdynamics.com/appd/23.x/latest/en/application-monitoring/install-app-server-agents/c-c++-sdk/install-the-c-c++-sdk-on-windows) on the machine or within the container running {{site.base_gateway}}. To use the AppDynamics plugin in {{site.base_gateway}}, the AppDynamics C/C++
SDK must be installed on all nodes running {{site.base_gateway}}. The `libappdynamics.so` shared
library file is the only required file.

For information about supported environments, see the [AppDynamics C/C++ SDK Supported Environments](https://docs.appdynamics.com/appd/23.x/latest/en/application-monitoring/install-app-server-agents/c-c++-sdk/c-c++-sdk-supported-environments) documentation.

### Recommended installation

If you are using {{site.base_gateway}} 3.0.0.0 or later, we recommended installing the `libappdynamics.so` in the `/usr/local/kong/lib` directory.
This directory is included in the {{site.base_gateway}} search path for shared libraries, so the `libappdynamics.so` file will be found automatically.

### Alternative installation

If you are using an older version of {{site.base_gateway}}, or if you prefer to install the `libappdynamics.so` file in a different location, you can do so.

- If {{site.base_gateway}} is deployed in RHEL or CentOS, the `libappdynamics.so` file can be in the `/usr/lib64` directory, which is included in the default search path for shared libraries.
- If {{site.base_gateway}} is deployed in Debian or Ubuntu, the `libappdynamics.so` file can be in the `/usr/lib` directory, which is included in the default search path for shared libraries.
- If above options are not available, the `libappdynamics.so` file can be in one of the locations configured by the [system's shared library loader](https://tldp.org/HOWTO/Program-Library-HOWTO/shared-libraries.html).
- Alternatively, the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variable can be set to the directory containing the `libappdynamics.so` file when starting {{site.base_gateway}}.

## Enable the AppDynamics plugin

The AppDynamics plugin is not bundled in {{site.base_gateway}} packages by default. 
Before you configure the plugin, you must enable it:

* **Package install:** Set `plugins=bundled,app-dynamics` in [`kong.conf`](/gateway/configuration/#plugins) before starting {{site.base_gateway}}
* **Docker:** Set `export KONG_PLUGINS=bundled,app-dynamics` in the environment
* **Kubernetes:** Set `KONG_PLUGINS=bundled,app-dynamics` using the [Custom Plugin](/kubernetes-ingress-controller/custom-plugins/) instructions.

## Plugin configuration

The AppDynamics plugin is configured through environment variables
that must be set when {{site.base_gateway}} is started. The AppDynamics plugin makes use of the AppDynamics C/C++ SDK to send
information to the AppDynamics controller. See the
[AppDynamics C/C++ SDK documentation](https://docs.appdynamics.com/appd/23.x/latest/en/application-monitoring/install-app-server-agents/c-c++-sdk/use-the-c-c++-sdk)
for more information about the configuration parameters.

## Agent logging

The AppDynamics agent sorts log information into separate log files, independent of {{site.base_gateway}} logs.
By default, log files are written to the `/tmp/appd` directory.
This location can be changed by setting the `KONG_APPD_LOGGING_LOG_DIR` environment variable.

If problems occur with the AppDynamics integration, inspect the AppDynamics agent's log files in addition to the {{site.base_gateway}} logs.

{:.warning}
> **Important:** ARM isn't supported when using the AppDynamics agent. The agent only supports x86 architecture.

## AppDynamics node name considerations

The AppDynamics plugin sets the `KONG_APPD_NODE_NAME` to the local
hostname by default, which typically reflects the container ID of the containerized
application. Multiple instances of the AppDynamics agent must use
different node names, and one agent must exist for each of {{site.base_gateway}}'s
worker processes, the node name is suffixed by the worker ID. This
results in multiple nodes being created for each {{site.base_gateway}}
instance, one for each worker process.
