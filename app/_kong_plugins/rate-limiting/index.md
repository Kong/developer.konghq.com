faqs:
  - q: Can I set different rate limits for different endpoints or services?
    a: Yes, you can configure rate limits on a per-service or per-route basis by applying the Rate Limiting plugin to specific services or routes in Kong.
  - q: "How does the `policy` option affect rate limiting?"
    a: |
      The `policy` option determines how rate limits are stored and enforced. The `local` policy uses Kongâ€™s in-memory storage, while the `redis` policy uses Redis, which is useful for distributed setups where rate limiting needs to be consistent across multiple Kong data plane nodes.

Rate limit how many HTTP requests can be made in a given period of seconds, minutes, hours, days, months, or years.
If the underlying Gateway Service or Route has no authentication layer, the [client IP address](#limit-by-ip-address) is used for identifying clients. 
Otherwise, the Consumer is used if an authentication plugin has been configured.

The advanced version of this plugin, [Rate Limiting Advanced](/plugins/rate-limiting-advanced/), provides the ability to apply
multiple limits in sliding or fixed windows, and includes Redis Sentinel and Redis Cluster support.

Kong also provides multiple specialized rate limiting plugins, including rate limiting across LLMs and GraphQL queries. 
See [Rate Limiting in {{site.base_gateway}}](/gateway/rate-limiting/) to choose the plugin that is most useful in your use case.
