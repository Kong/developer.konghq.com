  Consumers are required for HMAC authentication. Once you [create a Consumer](/gateway/entities/consumer/#set-up-a-consumer), you can configure the Consumer's credentials using one of the following methods:
    * **With a database:** Send a `POST` request to the `/consumers/{consumer}/hmac-auth` endpoint.
    * **Without a database:** Add a username and secret for authentication in your declarative config file in a `hmacauth_credentials` entry.

  For both methods, you'll add a username and optionally a secret used for authentication. If you don't add a secret, {{site.base_gateway}} will generate one for you.
