description: Configure the OpenTelemetry plugin to extract and preserve the tracing context in the same header type.
extended_description:  |
  This plugin configuration does the following:
  - Extract the tracing context using order of precedence: `w3c` > `b3` > `jaeger` > `ot` > `aws` > `datadog`
  - Inject the tracing context **in the extracted header type**
  - Default to `w3c` for context injection if none of the `extract` header types were found in the request
