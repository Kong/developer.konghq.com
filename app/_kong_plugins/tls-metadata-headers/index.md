The TLS Metadata Header plugin detects client certificates in requests, extracts the TLS metadata (such as the URL-encoded client certificate), and injects this metadata into HTTP headers. It does not validate client certificates.

Here are some use cases where the TLS Metadata Header plugin can be helpful:
* Pass TLS client certificate metadata to an upstream service, enabling it to perform validation of the proxied certificate
* Use the extracted metadata to route requests differently based on the client’s certificate metadata (for example, different routes for different departments or services)
* Enforce access control based on certain attributes of the client certificate, like the client’s organization (extracted from the certificate's subject DN)
* Log or audit extracted metadata from client certificates

{:.warning}
> **Important:** This plugin **must** be used in conjunction with another plugin that requests a client certificate, such as the [mTLS Authentication](/plugins/mtls-auth/) or [TLS Handshake Modifier](/plugins/tls-handshake-modifier/) plugins. 

## How it works

The TLS Metadata Header plugin accesses the client certificate and extracts the following metadata:
* The certificate itself
* Serial number
* Issuer Distinguished Name (DN)
* Subject DN
* SHA1 fingerprint
* Full client certificate chain

If [`config.inject_client_cert_details`](./reference/#schema--config-inject-client-cert-details) is enabled, the TLS Metadata Header plugin injects the extracted TLS client certificate metadata into HTTP headers.
