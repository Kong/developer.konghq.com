The Proxy Cache plugin provides a reverse proxy cache implementation for {{site.base_gateway}}. 
It caches response entities based on a configurable response code, content type, and request method.

The advanced version of this plugin, [Proxy Cache Advanced](/plugins/proxy-cache-advanced/), 
extends the Proxy Cache plugin with Redis, Redis Cluster, and Redis Sentinel support.

## How it works

The Proxy Cache plugin stores cache data in memory, which is a shared dictionary defined in [`config.memory.dictionary_name`](./reference/#schema--config-memory-dictionary-name).

The default dictionary, `kong_db_cache`, is also used by other plugins and functions of {{site.base_gateway}} to store unrelated database cache entities.
Using the `kong_db_cache` dictionary is an easy way to bootstrap and test the plugin, but we don't recommend using it for large-scale installations as significant usage will put pressure on other facets of {{site.base_gateway}}'s database caching operations. 
In production, we recommend defining a custom `lua_shared_dict` via a custom Nginx template.

Cache entities are stored for a [configurable period of time](./reference/#schema--config-cache-ttl), after which subsequent requests to the same resource will fetch and store the resource again. 

In [Traditional mode](/gateway/traditional-mode/), cache entities can also be [forcefully purged via the Admin API](#managing-cache-entities) prior to their expiration time.
