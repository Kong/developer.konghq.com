This plugin allows you to route a request to a specific [Upstream](/gateway/entities/upstream/) if it matches one of the
configured rules. 

## How it works

Each routing rule consists of a `condition` object and an `upstream_name` object. 
For each request coming into {{site.base_gateway}}, the plugin will try to find a rule in which
all the headers defined in the `condition` field have the same value as in the incoming request.
The first match dictates the Upstream to which the request is forwarded.

If more than one header is provided in a rule, the plugin looks for all of these headers
in the request. A request must contain all of the specified headers with the specified
values for a match to occur.
