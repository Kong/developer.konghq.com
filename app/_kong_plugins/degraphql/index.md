The DeGraphQL plugin transforms GraphQL upstreams into traditional endpoints by mapping URIs into GraphQL queries.

## How it works

DeGraphQL needs a GraphQL endpoint to query. 
This plugin must be activated on a Gateway Service or related Route that points to a GraphQL endpoint.

{{site.base_gateway}} receives traffic from clients and uses a Gateway Service with DeGraphQL routes to map URIs to GraphQL queries.

For a complete tutorial, see [Map URIs into GraphQL queries with DeGraphQL](/how-to/map-uris-into-graphql-queries/).

## Example DeGraphQL routes

The following sections define some common patterns for DeGraphQL routes.

{:.info}
> - Donâ€™t include the GraphQL server path prefix in the `uri` configuration parameter (`/graphql` by default). 
Only include the custom portion of the path that you want to configure. For example: `uri: /my-path`, but not `uri: /graphql/my-path`.
> - The content in the `query` field should follow [the GraphQL query syntax](https://graphql.org/learn/queries/).

### GraphQL query variables on URIs

GraphQL query variables can be applied on URIs.

Here's an example query that retrieves GitHub repository info from the GitHub GraphQL API:

```yaml
_format_version: "3.0"
custom_entities:
  - type: degraphql_routes
    fields:
      service:
        name: "github"
      uri: /:owner/:name
      query: |-
        query ($owner:String! $name:String!){
                        repository(owner:$owner, name:$name) {
                          name
                          forkCount
                          description
                        }
                      }
```
You can access the new route via `org-name/repo-name`:

```sh
curl http://localhost:8000/api/kong/kong \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer $GITHUB_TOKEN"
```


### GraphQL query variables as GET arguments

GraphQL query variables can be provided as `GET` arguments.

Here's an example query that retrieves GitHub repository info from the GitHub GraphQL API:

```yaml
_format_version: "3.0"
custom_entities:
  - type: degraphql_routes
    fields:
      service:
        name: "github"
      uri: /repo
      query: |-
        query ($owner:String! $name:String!){
                  repository(owner:$owner, name:$name) {
                    name
                    forkCount
                    description
                  }
                }
```

You can access the new route by appending `repo?owner=OWNER_NAME&name=REPO_NAME` to the request URL:

```sh
curl "http://localhost:8000/api/repo?owner=kong&name=kuma" \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer $GITHUB_TOKEN"
```
