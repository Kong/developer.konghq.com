The DeGraphQL plugin transforms GraphQL upstreams into traditional endpoints by mapping URIs into GraphQL queries.

## How it works

DeGraphQL needs a GraphQL endpoint to query. 
This plugin must be activated on a Gateway Service or related Route that points to a GraphQL endpoint.

{{site.base_gateway}} receives traffic from clients and uses a Gateway Service with DeGraphQL routes to map URIs to GraphQL queries.

## Example DeGraphQL routes

The following sections define some common patterns for DeGraphQL routes.

{:.info}
> Don‚Äôt include the GraphQL server path prefix in the URI parameter (`/graphql` by default).

### GraphQL query variables on URIs

GraphQL query variables can be applied on URIs.

Here's an example query that retrieves GitHub repository info from the GitHub GraphQL API:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8001/services/github/degraphql/routes \
  --data uri='/:owner/:name' \
  --data query='query ($owner:String! $name:String!){
                  repository(owner:$owner, name:$name) {
                    name
                    forkCount
                    description
                 }
               }'

```
You can access it via `org-name/repo-name`:

```sh
curl http://localhost:8000/api/kong/kong \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer $GITHUB_TOKEN"
```

Response:
```json
{
  "data": {
      "repository": {
          "description": "ü¶ç The Cloud-Native API Gateway ",
          "forkCount": 2997,
          "name": "kong"
      }
  }
}
```

### GraphQL query variables as GET arguments

GraphQL query variables can be provided as `GET` arguments.

Here's an example query that retrieves GitHub repository info from the GitHub GraphQL API:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8001/services/github/degraphql/routes \
  --data uri='/repo' \
  --data query='query ($owner:String! $name:String!){
                  repository(owner:$owner, name:$name) {
                    name
                    forkCount
                    description
                  }
                }'
```

You can access it via the URL query `repo?owner=owner-name&name=repo-name`:

```sh
curl "http://localhost:8000/api/repo?owner=kong&name=kuma" \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer some-token"
```

Response:
```json
{
  "data": {
      "repository": {
          "description": "üêª The Universal Service Mesh",
          "forkCount": 48,
          "name": "kuma"
      }
  }
}
```
