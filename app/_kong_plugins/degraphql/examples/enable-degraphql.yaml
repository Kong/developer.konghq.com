  Enable the DeGraphQL plugin to disable regular Gateway Service function. 
  
  Once the plugin is enabled, it builds the path and GraphQL query to hit the GraphQL service with. 
  Any connected Gateway Services represent your REST API and not the GraphQL endpoint itself. 
  {{site.base_gateway}} will return a `404 Not Found` status code if no DeGraphQL routes have been configured.

  For a complete tutorial which shows you how to create a service and GraphQL routes, see [Map URIs into GraphQL queries with DeGraphQL](/how-to/map-uris-into-graphql-queries/).
