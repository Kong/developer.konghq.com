@TODO

## {{site.mesh_product_name}}

Kubernetes provides its own RBAC system but it does not allow you to: 

* Restrict access to a resource on a specific Mesh. 
* Restrict access based on the content of the policy.

{{site.mesh_product_name}} RBAC works on top of Kubernetes providing two globally scoped (not bound to {{site.mesh_product_name}}) resources to aid in implementing RBAC.
