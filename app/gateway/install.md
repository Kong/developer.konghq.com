  - q: How do I migrate from {{site.base_gateway}} open source (OSS) to {{site.ee_product_name}}?
    a: |
        You can migrate to {{site.ee_product_name}} using the `kong migrations` CLI commands.
        
        {:.danger}
        > **Warning:** This action is irreversible, therefore we strongly recommend [backing up](/gateway/upgrade/backup-and-restore/) your production data before migrating from {{site.base_gateway}} OSS to {{site.ee_product_name}}.
        
        You can only migrate to a {{site.ee_product_name}} version that supports the same OSS version. The latest version of {{site.base_gateway}} OSS is {{site.latest_gateway_oss_version}}.

        1. Download the {{site.ee_product_name}} package that matches your installed OSS version.
        1. Configure it to point to the same data store as your {{site.base_gateway}} OSS node.
           The migration command expects the data store to be up to date on any pending migration:

           ```sh
           kong migrations up [-c configuration_file]
           kong migrations -f finish [-c configuration_file]
           ```

           {:.warning}
           > **Caution**: {% include_cached /gateway/migration-finish-warning.md %}

        1. Confirm that all of the entities are now available on your {{site.ee_product_name}} node.
        1. (Optional) [Upgrade](/gateway/upgrade/) to your desired version of {{site.ee_product_name}}. 
  - q: "How do I install {{site.base_gateway}} on Windows?"
    a: |
      To install {{site.base_gateway}} on Windows, use [Docker](#docker). Kong does not provide a native Windows install method for {{site.base_gateway}}.
  - q: Where can I find all supported platforms and packaging options? 
    a: |
      To find all supported platforms and package types for {{site.base_gateway}}, see the [supported platforms and versions](/gateway/version-support-policy/#supported-versions) in the {{site.base_gateway}} version support policy.
