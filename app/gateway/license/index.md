@TODO

content ideas:
* Mostly use content from https://docs.konghq.com/gateway/3.9.x/licenses/report/
* what is a license report and why you'd use them 
* what information is on a license report
* how do you generate a license report (JSON + TAR), link to license Admin API
* Reference section about fields that display in the report (the content strategy spreadsheet mentions this being autogenerated, though it currently isn't autogenerated)
* An example report to show how things are formatted? 
* this contains links to other reference/landing page topics about health check, performance, etc.
