  Kong supports two kinds of health checks, which can be used separately or in conjunction: active and passive (also known as circuit breakers).

@todo

Use https://docs.konghq.com/gateway/latest/how-kong-works/health-checks/
Probably need a separate how-to as well - how do you actually enable and use a health check? What entities are involved (Upstream, Targets)? Does any of this info actually belong in the Upstream or Target entity docs?
