{{site.base_gateway}} provides a granular logging facility through its Admin API. This
allows cluster administrators to keep detailed track of changes made to the
cluster configuration throughout its lifetime, aiding in compliance efforts and
providing valuable data points during forensic investigations. Generated audit
log trails are [Workspace](/gateway/api/admin-ee/latest/#/Workspaces) and [RBAC](/gateway/api/admin-ee/latest/#/rbac)-aware,
providing Kong operators a deep and wide look into changes happening within
the cluster.
