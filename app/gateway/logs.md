Logging in {{site.base_gateway}} allows you to 

## Log levels

By default, logs are set to the recommended `notice` level. If logs are too chatty, you can increase the level to something like `warn`. 

| Level | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `debug` | It provides debug information about the pluginâ€™s run loop and each individual plugin or other components. This should only be used during debugging, the debug option, if left on for extended periods of time, can result in excess disk space consumption. |
| `info` and `notice` | Kong does not make a big difference between both these levels. Provides information about normal behavior most of which can be ignored. |
| `warn` | To log any abnormal behavior that doesn't result in dropped transactions but requires further investigation, `warn` level should be used. |
| `error` | Used for logging errors that result in a request being dropped (for example getting  an HTTP 500 error). The rate of such logs need to be monitored. |
| `crit` | This level is used when Kong is working under critical conditions and not working properly thereby affecting several clients. Nginx also provides `alert` and `emerg` levels but currently Kong doesn't make use of these levels making `crit` the highest severity log level. |

## Configure log levels

You can configure log levels and settings using the Admin API.

| Use case | API endpoint | Description |
|----------|--------------|-------------|
| View current log level |  |  |
| Modify the log level for an individual Kong Gateway node |  |  |
| Change the log level of the Kong Gateway cluster |  |  |
| Manage new nodes in the cluster |  |  |
| Change the log level of all control plane Kong Gateway nodes |  |  |

## Log the client request identifier

The `X-Kong-Request-Id` header contains a unique identifier for each client request. This is enabled by default both upstream and downstream. This unique ID helps in matching specific requests to their corresponding error logs, which is useful for debugging. If {{site.base_gateway}} returns an error by calling the PDK `kong.response.error`, the request ID will also be included in the response body generated by {{site.base_gateway}}. In addition, any {{site.base_gateway}} error log generated will contain the same request ID, with the format: `request_id: xxx`.

The log line produced by the debug header as well as the debug response header contains the request ID. You can use this to search for the debug header output using a log viewer UI. This is especially useful when the debug output is too long to fit in the response header.

This feature can be customized for upstreams and downstreams using the [`headers`](/gateway/latest/reference/configuration/#headers) and [`headers_upstream`](/gateway/latest/reference/configuration/#headers_upstream) configuration options.
