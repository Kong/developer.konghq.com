This plugin invokes [OpenWhisk Actions](https://github.com/apache/openwhisk/blob/master/docs/actions.md).
The Apache OpenWhisk plugin can be used in combination with other [request plugins](/plugins/?terms=request) to secure, manage, or extend the function.

## Install the OpenWhisk plugin

This plugin is not bundled with {{site.base_gateway}}.

1. Install the OpenWhisk plugin using the [LuaRocks](https://luarocks.org/) package manager:

   ```sh
   luarocks install kong-plugin-openwhisk
   ```

2. Update your loaded plugins list in {{site.base_gateway}}.

   In your [`kong.conf`](/gateway/configuration/), append `openwhisk` to the `plugins` field. Make sure the field isn't commented out.

   ```yaml
   plugins = bundled,openwhisk
   ```

3. Restart {{site.base_gateway}}:

   ```sh
   kong restart
   ```

You can also install the OpenWhisk plugin from [source](https://github.com/Kong/kong-plugin-openwhisk).

## Using the OpenWhisk plugin

To learn how to use this plugin with OpenWhisk, see the [Kong OpenWhisk plugin README](https://github.com/Kong/kong-plugin-openwhisk).

## Limitations of the OpenWhisk plugin

### Using a fake upstream service

When using the OpenWhisk plugin, the response is returned by the plugin itself without proxying the request to any upstream service. This means that a Gateway Service's `host`, `port`, `path` properties are ignored, but must still be specified for the entity to be validated by {{site.base_gateway}}. 
The `host` property in particular must either be an IP address, or a hostname that gets resolved by your nameserver.

### Response plugins

There is a known limitation in the system that prevents some response plugins from being executed.
