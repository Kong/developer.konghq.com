Wallarm Advanced API Security and WAAP products provide robust protection for APIs, microservices, and serverless workloads running in cloud-native environments. 
Wallarm helps Security and DevOps teams get unique visibility into malicious traffic, robust protection across their whole API portfolio, and automated incident response for product security programs. 

Wallarm supports modern tech stacks, offering dozens of deployment options in public clouds, multi-cloud, and Kubernetes-based environments, in addition to providing a full cloud solution. 
Wallarm provides the following benefits:

* Protect your web applications and APIs against OWASP Security Top-10 risks and other advanced API threats like injections, Broken Object Level Authorization (BOLA), and authentication failures.
* Get runtime visibility across your entire API portfolio, minimize API drift, and prioritize security efforts (like pen tests or bug bounties) with alerts on new, changed, or deprecated endpoints.
* Meet compliance requirements by tracking and protecting sensitive data, including personally identifiable information (PII), financial and health data, credentials and more.
