description: "While {{site.base_gateway}} is optimized out-of-the-box, there are still situations where tweaking some configuration options for {{site.base_gateway}} can substantially increase its performance. You can establish a baseline for performance by running an initial benchmark of {{site.base_gateway}}, optimizing the kong.conf file using the recommendations in this guide, and then conducting several additional benchmark tests."
