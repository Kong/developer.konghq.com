The Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) 140-2 specifies the security requirements that must be satisfied by a cryptographic module. The FIPS {{site.base_gateway}} package is compliant with this standard when running in FIPS mode, using only approved algorithms. However, it has not been submitted for NIST validation.

{{site.ee_product_name}} provides FIPS 140-2 compliant packages for the following distributions:

* Ubuntu 22.04
* RHEL 9

The package uses the OpenSSL 3.0 FIPS module to perform cryptographic operations.

## Non-Cryptographic Use of Cryptographic Algorithms

FIPS defines approved algorithms for cryptographic use, but does not restrict non-cryptographic uses. Some components of {{site.base_gateway}} use such algorithms for purposes like hashing IDs or load balancing.

## SSL Client Support in FIPS Mode

FIPS 140-2 only addresses SSL server compliance. {{site.base_gateway}} supports FIPS-compliant server operations in version 3.0. SSL clients are not governed by FIPS, and therefore are not subject to specific compliance handling.

Client operations include:

* Making HTTPS requests via Lua
* Using PostgreSQL over SSL
* Upstream services proxied over HTTPS
