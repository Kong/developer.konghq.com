The in-place upgrade strategy is a {{site.base_gateway}} upgrade option used primarily for traditional mode deployments and for control planes in hybrid mode. 
An in-place upgrade reuses the existing database.

In comparison to [dual-cluster upgrades](/gateway/upgrade/dual-cluster/), the in-place upgrade uses less resources, but causes business downtime.

This guide refers to the old version as cluster X and the new version as cluster Y.
For this upgrade method, you have to shut down cluster X, then configure the new cluster Y to point to the database.

> _Figure 1: The diagram shows an in-place upgrade workflow, where the current cluster X is directly replaced by a new cluster Y._
_The database is reused by the new cluster Y, and the current cluster X is shut down once all nodes are migrated. No Admin API write operations can be performed during the upgrade._

There is business downtime as cluster X is stopped during the upgrade process. 
You must carefully review the [upgrade considerations](/gateway/upgrade/#preparation-upgrade-considerations) in advance.

{:.warning}
> **Important**: We do not recommend using this strategy unless {{site.base_gateway}} is deployed under 
an extremely resource-constrained environment, or unless you can't obtain new resources in a 
timely manner for a dual-cluster upgrade.

> The current cluster X can be substituted in place with the new cluster Y.
However, this strategy does not prevent you from deploying the new cluster Y on a different machine.

## Upgrade using the in-place method

{:.info}
> The following steps are intended as a guideline.
The exact execution of these steps will vary depending on your environment. 

### Prerequisites

* Review the [general upgrade guide](/gateway/upgrade/) to prepare for the upgrade and review your options.
* You have a traditional deployment or you need to upgrade the control planes (CPs) in a hybrid mode deployment.
* You can't perform [dual-cluster upgrades](/gateway/upgrade/dual-cluster/) due to resource limitations.

### Prepare the upgrade

1. Stop any {{site.base_gateway}} configuration updates (e.g. Admin API calls). 
This is critical to guarantee data consistency between cluster X and cluster Y.

2. Back up data from the current cluster X by following the 
[backup guide](/gateway/upgrade/backup-and-restore/).

3. Evaluate factors that may impact the upgrade, as described in [Upgrade considerations](/gateway/upgrade/#preparation-upgrade-considerations/).
You may have to consider customization of both `kong.conf` and {{site.base_gateway}} configuration data.

4. Evaluate any changes that have happened between releases:
    * [Breaking changes](/gateway/breaking-changes/)
    * [Full changelog](/gateway/changelog/)

### Switch the cluster

1. Stop the {{site.base_gateway}} nodes of the old cluster X but keep the database running. 
This will create a period of downtime until the upgrade completes.

2. Install a new cluster running version Y as instructed in the 
    [{{site.base_gateway}} Installation Options](/gateway/install/) and 
    point it at the existing database for cluster X.
    
    Provision the new cluster Y with the same-sized resource capacity as that of 
    the current cluster X.

3. Migrate the database to the new version by running `kong migrations up`. 

4. When complete, run `kong migrations finish`.

5. Start the new cluster Y.

Once this is done, actively monitor all proxy metrics. If you run into any issues, [roll back the upgrade](/gateway/upgrade/backup-and-restore/#restore-gateway-entities). 
Prioritize the database-level restoration method over the application-level method.

When there are no more issues, decommission the old cluster X to complete the upgrade. 

Write updates to {{site.base_gateway}} can now be performed, though we suggest you keep monitoring metrics for a while.
