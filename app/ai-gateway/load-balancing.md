Kong AI Gateway gives you advanced load balancing capabilities to efficiently distribute requests across multiple LLM models. This helps you ensure fault tolerance, optimize resource utilization, and balance traffic across your AI systems.

With the AI Proxy Advanced plugin, you can select from several load balancing algorithmsâ€”similar to those used for Kong upstreams but extended for AI model routing. You configure load balancing using the [Upstream entity](/gateway/entities/upstream/), giving you flexibility to fine-tune how requests are routed to various AI providers and LLM models.

### Load balancing algorithms

Kong AI Gateway supports multiple load balancing strategies to optimize traffic distribution across AI models. Each algorithm is suited for different performance goals such as balancing load, improving cache-hit ratios, reducing latency, or ensuring [failover reliability](#retry-and-fallback).

The table below provides a detailed overview of the available algorithms, along with considerations to keep in mind when selecting the best option for your use case.

{% table %}
columns:
  - title: Algorithm
    key: algorithm
  - title: Description
    key: description
  - title: Considerations
    key: considerations
rows:
  - algorithm: "[Round-robin (weighted)](/plugins/ai-proxy-advanced/examples/round-robin/)"
    description: |
      Distributes requests across models in a circular pattern with weight-based allocation. The [`weight`](/plugins/ai-proxy-advanced/reference/#schema--config-targets-weight) parameter (for example, `weight: 70`) controls the proportion of traffic sent to each model. By default, all models have the same weight and receive the same percentage of requests.
    considerations: |
      * Traffic is routed proportionally based on weights.
      * Requests follow a sequence adjusted by weight.
      * Focuses purely on traffic distribution, not cache-hit ratios.
  - algorithm: "[Consistent-hashing](/plugins/ai-proxy-advanced/examples/consistent-hashing/)"
    description: |
      Routes requests based on a hash of a configurable client input, such as a header or user ID. The [`hash_on_header`](/plugins/ai-proxy-advanced/reference/#schema--config-balancer-hash-on-header) setting (for example, `X-Hashing-Header`) defines the source for the hash and drives all routing decisions. By default, the header is set to `X-Kong-LLM-Request-ID`.
    considerations: |
      * Especially effective with consistent keys like user IDs.
      * Requires diverse hash inputs for balanced distribution.
      * Ideal for maintaining session persistence.
  - algorithm: "[Lowest-usage](/plugins/ai-proxy-advanced/examples/lowest-usage/)"
    description: |
      Routes requests to the least-utilized models based on resource usage metrics. In the configuration, the [`tokens_count_strategy`](/plugins/ai-proxy-advanced/reference/#schema--config-balancer-tokens-count-strategy) (for example, `prompt-tokens`) defines how usage is measured, focusing on prompt tokens or other resource indicators.
    considerations: |
      * Dynamically balances load based on measured usage.
      * Useful for optimizing cost and avoiding overloading heavier models.
      * Ensures more efficient resource allocation across available models.
  - algorithm: "[Lowest-latency](/plugins/ai-proxy-advanced/examples/lowest-latency/)"
    description: |
      Routes requests to the models with the lowest observed latency. In the configuration, the [`latency_strategy`](/plugins/ai-proxy-advanced/reference/#schema--config-balancer-latency-strategy) parameter (for example, `latency_strategy: e2e`) defines how latency is measured, typically based on end-to-end response times. By default, the latency is calculated based on the time the model takes to generate each token (`tpot`)
    considerations: |
      * Prioritizes models with the fastest response times.
      * Optimizes for real-time performance in time-sensitive applications.
      * Less suitable for long-lived or persistent connections (e.g., WebSockets).
  - algorithm: "[Semantic](/plugins/ai-proxy-advanced/examples/semantic/)"
    description: |
      Routes requests based on semantic similarity between the prompt and model descriptions. In the configuration, embeddings are generated using a specified model (e.g., `text-embedding-3-small`), and similarity is calculated using vector search.
    considerations: |
      * Uses vector search (for example, Redis) to find the best match based on prompt embeddings.
      * `distance_metric` and `threshold` settings fine-tune matching sensitivity.
      * Best for routing prompts to domain-specialized models, like coding, analytics, text generation.
  - algorithm: "[Priority](/plugins/ai-proxy-advanced/examples/priority/)"
    description: |
      Routes requests to models based on assigned priority groups and weights. In the configuration, models are grouped by priority and can have individual [`weight`](/plugins/ai-proxy-advanced/reference/#schema--config-targets-weight) settings (for example, `weight: 70` for GPT-4), allowing proportional load distribution within each priority tier. 
      
      By default, all models have the same priority. The balancer always chooses one of the targets in the group with the highest priority first. If all targets in the highest priority group are down, the balancer chooses one of the targets in the next highest priority group.
    considerations: |
      * Traffic first targets higher-priority groups; lower-priority groups are used only if needed (failover).
      * Useful for balancing reliability, cost-efficiency, and resource optimization.
      * Ideal for high-availability deployments needing controlled fallback behavior.

### Retry and fallback

The load balancer includes built-in support for **retries** and **fallbacks**. When a request fails, the balancer can automatically retry the same target or redirect the request to a different upstream target.


#### How retry and fallback works

1. Client sends a request.
2. The load balancer selects a target based on the configured algorithm (round-robin, lowest-latency, etc.).
3. If the target fails (based on defined `failover_criteria`), the balancer:

   * **Retries** the same or another target.
   * **Fallbacks** to another available target.

4. If retries are exhausted without success, the load balancer returns a failure to the client.

#### Retry and fallback configuration

The AI Gateway load balancer offers several configuration options to fine-tune request retries, timeouts, and failover behavior:

columns:
  - title: Setting
    key: setting
  - title: Description
    key: description
rows:
  - setting: "[`retries`](/plugins/ai-proxy-advanced/reference/#schema--config-balancer-retries)"
    description: |
      Defines how many times to retry a failed request before reporting failure to the client.
      Increase for better resilience to transient errors; decrease if you need lower latency and faster failure.
  - setting: "[`failover_criteria`](/plugins/ai-proxy-advanced/reference/#schema--config-balancer-failover-criteria)"
    description: |
      Specifies which types of failures (e.g., `http_429`, `http_500`) should trigger a failover to a different target.
      Customize based on your tolerance for specific errors and desired failover behavior.
  - setting: "[`connect_timeout`](/plugins/ai-proxy-advanced/reference/#schema--config-balancer-connect-timeout)"
    description: |
      Sets the maximum time allowed to establish a TCP connection with a target.
      Lower it for faster detection of unreachable servers; raise it if some servers may respond slowly under load.
  - setting: "[`read_timeout`](/plugins/ai-proxy-advanced/reference/#schema--config-balancer-read-timeout)"
    description: |
      Defines the maximum time to wait for a server response after sending a request.
      Lower it for real-time applications needing quick responses; increase it for long-running operations.
  - setting: "[`write_timeout`](/plugins/ai-proxy-advanced/reference/#schema--config-balancer-write-timeout)"
    description: |
      Sets the maximum time allowed to send the request payload to the server.
      Increase if large request bodies are common; keep short for small, fast payloads.
