faqs:
  - q: Do I have to enable Workspaces? 
    a: |
     No, {{site.base_gateway}} Enterprise ships with the `default` Workspace. You can create additional Workspaces, but the default Workspace will always remain, and can't be deleted.
  - q: Are there entities that can't exist in a Workspace?
    a: |
      There are certain entities that can't exist within a Workspace:
      * [CA Certificates](/gateway/entities/ca-certificate/) apply to all Workspaces. They're used to verify the client certificates in mTLS handshakes. 
      The SSL handshake takes place before receiving an HTTP request when the Workspace is unknown.
      * [RBAC](/gateway/entities/rbac/) entities - Users, Roles, Admins, Groups - exist outside of a Workspace. However, you must assign Workspace-specific Roles for any User, Admin, or Group to access entities in a specific Workspace.
      * Other Workspaces can't exist within a Workspace.
  - q: Can I use Workspaces in Konnect?
    a: |
      No. Instead, {{site.konnect_short_name}} offers the more powerful Control Planes and Control Plane Groups to manage entities within an API ecosystem.

  - q: Can a Workspace share a name with another Workspace?
    a: |
      Two Workspaces can't share the same name. However, Workspace names are case sensitive - for example, “Payments” and “payments” are not equal and would be accepted as two different Workspaces. 
      We recommend giving Workspaces unique names regardless of letter case to prevent confusion.
  - q: What happens if I create an entity without specifying a Workspace?
    a: If you don't specify a target Workspace, the entity will be created in the `default` workspace.

## What is a Workspace?

Workspaces are a way of namespacing {{site.base_gateway}} entities so they can be managed independently. Workspaces work in combination with [RBAC](/gateway/entities/rbac/) to create isolated environments for teams to operate independently of each other. Workspaces can't share entities, like Services, between them, and only Workspace Admins with the correct permissions, in the Workspace, can manage them. 

Workspaces support multi-tenancy by isolating {{site.base_gateway}} configuration objects. When paired with RBAC, {{site.base_gateway}} administrators can effectively create tenants within the control plane. The Workspace administrators have segregated and secure access to only their portion of the {{site.base_gateway}} configuration in Kong Manager, the Admin API, and the declarative configuration tool decK.

### How does {{site.base_gateway}} resolve entity conflicts between Workspaces?

Routing rules are configured at the data plane level. The data plane routes client traffic based on the configuration applied across all Workspaces. Configuring entities related to routing, such as [Gateway Services](/gateway/entities/service/) and [Routes](/gateway/entities/route/), alter the client traffic routing behavior of the data plane, but {{site.base_gateway}} will always attempt to ensure that routing rules don't contain conflicts. 

To route traffic to the appropriate Workspace, {{site.base_gateway}} uses a conflict detection algorithm.

When a Service or Route is **created** or **modified**, the {{site.base_gateway}} Router checks for the existence of that object before allowing the operation to proceed in this order:

1. If the Service or Route created is unique across all Workspaces, the new entity is created. 
1. If an existing Service or Route object in the current Workspace has the same name as the one being created, a `409 Conflict` error is returned. 
2. If an equivalent Service or Route is found in a different Workspace, and the host is provided:
    1. If the host field matches in both Workspaces, a `409 Conflict` error is returned.
    1. If the host field doesn't match, the new entity can be created.
    1. If the host is an absolute value, a `409 Conflict` error is returned.

## Roles, groups, and permissions

Because Workspaces allow users to control {{site.base_gateway}} entities in isolation, users must have the correct permissions to configure a particular Workspace. Users will require either a Super Admin or Admin role to configure Workspaces. 

The following table details which Workspace permissions each Admin role has:

## Manage Workspaces with decK 

The following decK flags must be used when interfacing with Workspaces using decK. 

### Manage multiple Workspaces

To manage all Workspaces at once, use the `--all-workspaces` flag with decK:

```sh
deck gateway dump --all-workspaces
```
This will dump your configuration into individual yaml files with the specific Workspace name including `default`. 

You can set a Workspace specifically within a decK file like this: 

```
_format_version: "3.0"
_workspace: default
services:
- name: example_service
```
### Deploy Workspace-specific config 

decK configurations must be deployed on a per-Workspace basis, individually. This is achieved using the `--workspace` flag: 

```sh
deck gateway sync default.yaml --workspace default
```

### Delete a Workspace configuration

decK can't delete Workspaces. However, using `deck gateway reset` in combination with the `--workspace` or `--all-workspaces` flags forces decK to delete the entire configuration inside the Workspace, but not the Workspace itself.
