## What is a Target?

A Target identifies an instance of an upstream service using an IP address or hostname with a port.
Each [Upstream](/gateway/entities/upstream/) can have many Targets. Targets are used by Upstreams for [load balancing](/gateway/entities/upstream/#load-balancing-algorithms). For example, if you have an `example_upstream` Upstream, you can point it to two different Targets: `httpbin.konghq.com` and `httpbun.com`. This is so that if one of the servers (like `httpbin.konghq.com`) is unavailable, it automatically detects the problem and routes all traffic to the working server (`httpbun.com`).

The following diagram illustrates how Targets are used by Upstreams for load balancing:

## Using hostnames

A Target can also have a hostname instead of an IP address. 
In that case, the name is resolved and all entries found are individually added to the load balancer.

For example, let's say you add `api.host.com:123` with `weight=100`:

* If the hostname `api.host.com` resolves to an A record with 2 IP addresses, both IP addresses are added as a target, each with `weight=100` and port 123.
* If the hostname resolves to an SRV record, then the `port` and `weight` fields from the DNS record are used, and override the port and weight set in the Target.

The balancer honors the DNS record's `ttl` setting. Upon expiry, it queries the nameserver and updates the balancer. 
When a DNS record has `ttl=0`, the hostname is added as a single target, with the specified weight. The nameserver is queried for every request, adding latency to the request.

type: target
data:
  target: httpbun.com:80
  weight: 100
{% endentity_example %}
