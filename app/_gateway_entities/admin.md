## What is the Admins entity? 
The Admins entity in {{site.base_gateway}} is an [RBAC](/gateway/entities/rbac) entity used to used to manage all administrators for a specific [Workspace](/gateway/entities/workspace). 
The Admins entity can be managed using the Admin API or Kong Manager and is used in the following operations:

* [Admin registration](/api/gateway/admin-ee/3.9/#/operations/post-admins-register)
* [Password reset](/api/gateway/admin-ee/3.9/#/operations/get-admins-password_resets)
* [Read, Update Delete Admins](/api/gateway/admin-ee/3.9/#/operations/patch-admins-name_or_id-generate_register_url)
* [Viewing roles for specific Admins](/api/gateway/admin-ee/3.9/#/operations/get-admins-name_or_id-roles)
* [Creating, updating and deleting Admin roles](/api/gateway/admin-ee/3.9/#/operations/post-admins-name_or_id-roles)
* [Viewing associated Workspaces](/api/gateway/admin-ee/3.9/#/operations/get-admins-name_or_id-workspaces)


Admins can only interact with entities from within their Workspace, depending on the Admin's specific role they can enforce RBAC roles and permissions across that Workspace, including creating and inviting other Admins. 

## Kong Manager

Kong Manager has the capability to manage the Admin's entity and can handle all operations that can be managed with the Admin API. {{site.base_gateway}} should be configured to have [RBAC enabled](/gateway/entities/rbac/#enable-rbac), as well as configured for [sending email](/how-to/configure-kong-manager-email). To enable RBAC on Kong Manager to be able to configure the Admins entity, set the following: 

* Set `enforce_rbac` to `on`
* Set `admin_gui_auth `to the desired authentication like `basic-auth`
* Add a session secret to `admin_gui_session_conf`

You can do all of this automatically with the

## Invite an Admin

Inviting an Admin can only be done if you have [Enabled RBAC](/gateway/entities/rbac/#enable-rbac). You can invite an Admin by issuing a `POST` request to [`/admins/`](/api/gateway/admin-ee/3.9/#/operations/post-admins). If you have not configured [sending email](/how-to/configure-kong-manager-email) your Admin will not receive an invite link, but will still be created.
