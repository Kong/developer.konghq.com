## What is a service?

{{ page.description }} Services can store collections of objects like plugin configurations, and policies, and they can be associated with routes.

When defining a service, the administrator provides a name and the upstream application connection information. The connection details can be provided in the url field as a single string, or by providing individual values for protocol, host, port, and path individually.

Services have a one-to-many relationship with upstream applications, which allows administrators to create sophisticated traffic management behaviors.

Services, in conjunction with [routes](/gateway/entities/route/), let you expose your services to clients with {{site.base_gateway}}. {{site.base_gateway}} abstracts the service from the clients by using routes. Since the client always calls the route, changes to the services (like versioning) donâ€™t impact how clients make the call. Routes also allow the same service to be used by multiple clients and apply different policies based on the route used.
