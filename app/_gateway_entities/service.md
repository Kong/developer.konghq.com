## What is a Gateway Service?

Gateway Services represent the service applications in your system. 
These applications are the business logic components of your system responsible for responding to requests. 

The configuration of a Gateway Service defines the connectivity details between the {{site.base_gateway}} and the service application, along with other metadata. Generally, you should map one Gateway Service to each service application.

For simple deployments, the upstream URL can be provided directly in the Gateway Service. For sophisticated traffic management needs, a Gateway Service can point at an [Upstream](/gateway/entities/upstream/).

Gateway Services, in conjunction with [Routes](/gateway/entities/route/), let you expose your service applications to clients with {{site.base_gateway}}.

[Plugins](/gateway/entities/plugin/) can be attached to a Service, and will run against every request that triggers a request to the Service that they're attached to.
