faqs:
  - q: What types of fields can be used in Vaults?
    a: Vaults work with "referenceable" fields. All fields in `kong.conf` are referenceable and some fields within entities (for example, plugins, certificates) are also. Refer to the appropriate entity documentation to learn more.
  - q: Can Vaults be referenced during custom plugin development?
    a: Yes. The plugin development kit (PDK) offers a Vaults module (`kong.vault`) that can be used to resolve, parse, and verify Vault references.
  - q: What data types can I use when referencing a secret in a Vault?
    a: A secret reference points to a string value. No other data types are currently supported.
  - q: I have a secret with multiple versions, how do I specify an earlier version when I'm referencing the secret?
    a: |
      If you have a secret with multiple versions, you can access the current version or any previous version of the secret by specifying a version in the reference.

      In the following AWS example, `AWSCURRENT` refers to the latest secret version and `AWSPREVIOUS` refers to an older version:
      ```sh
      # For AWSCURRENT, not specifying version
      {vault://aws/secret-name/foo}

      # For AWSCURRENT, specifying version == 1
      {vault://aws/secret-name/foo#1}

      # For AWSPREVIOUS, specifying version == 2
      {vault://aws/secret-name/foo#2}
      ```
      This applies to all providers with versioned secrets.
  - q: My secret in AWS Secret Manager has a `/` backslash in the secret name. How do I reference this secret in {{site.base_gateway}}?
    a: |
      The slash symbol (`/`) is a valid character for the secret name in AWS Secrets Manager. If you want to reference a secret name that starts with a slash or has two consecutive slashes, transform one of the slashes in the name into URL-encoded format. For example:
      * A secret named `/secret/key` should be referenced as `{vault://aws/%2Fsecret/key}`
      * A secret named `secret/path//aaa/key` should be referenced as `{vault://aws/secret/path/%2Faaa/key}`
      
      Since {{site.base_gateway}} tries to resolve the secret reference as a valid URL, using a slash instead of a URL-encoded slash will result in unexpected secret name fetching.
  - q: I have secrets stored in multiple AWS Secret Manager regions, how do I reference those secrets in {{site.base_gateway}}?
    a: |
      You can create multiple Vault entities, one per region with the `config.region` parameter. You'd then reference the secret by the name of the Vault:
      ```sh
      {vault://aws-eu-central-vault/secret-name/foo}
      {vault://aws-us-west-vault/secret-name/snip}
      ```
  - q: I'm using Google Workload Identity, how do I configure a Vault?
    a: |
      To use GCP Secret Manager with
      [Workload Identity](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/workload-identity)
      on a GKE cluster, update your pod spec so that the service account (`GCP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT`) is
      attached to the pod. For configuration information, read the [Workload
      Identity configuration
      documentation](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/workload-identity#authenticating_to).

      {:.info}
      > **Notes:**
      > * With Workload Identity, setting the `GCP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT` isn't necessary.
      > * When using GCP Vault as a backend, make sure you have configured `system` as part of the
      > [`lua_ssl_trusted_certificate` configuration directive](/gateway/configuration/#lua-ssl-trusted-certificate)
      so that the SSL certificates used by the official GCP API can be trusted by {{site.base_gateway}}.
  - q: How does {{site.base_gateway}} retrieve secrets from HashiCorp Vault?
    a: |
      {{site.base_gateway}} retrieves secrets from HashiCorp Vault's HTTP API through a two-step process: authentication and secret retrieval.

      **Step 1: Authentication**

      Depending on the authentication method defined in `config.auth_method`, {{site.base_gateway}} authenticates to HashiCorp Vault using one of the following methods:

      - If you're using the `token` auth method, {{site.base_gateway}} uses the `config.token` as the client token.
      - If you're using the `kubernetes` auth method, {{site.base_gateway}} uses the service account JWT token mounted in the pod (path defined in the `config.kube_api_token_file`) to call the login API for the Kubernetes auth path on the HashiCorp Vault server and retrieve a client token.
      - {% new_in 3.4 %} If you're using the `approle` auth method, {{site.base_gateway}} uses the AppRole credentials to retrieve a client token. The AppRole role ID is configured by field `config.approle_role_id`, and the secret ID is configured by field `config.approle_secret_id` or `config.approle_secret_id_file`. 
        - If you set `config.approle_response_wrapping` to `true`, then the secret ID configured by
        `config.approle_secret_id` or `config.approle_secret_id_file` will be a response wrapping token, 
        and {{site.base_gateway}} will call the unwrap API `/v1/sys/wrapping/unwrap` to unwrap the response wrapping token to fetch 
        the real secret ID. {{site.base_gateway}} will use the AppRole role ID and secret ID to call the login API for the AppRole auth path
        on the HashiCorp Vault server and retrieve a client token.
      
      By calling the login API, {{site.base_gateway}} will retrieve a client token and then use it in the next step as the value of `X-Vault-Token` header to retrieve a secret.

      **Step 2: Retrieving the secret**

      {{site.base_gateway}} uses the client token retrieved in the authentication step to call the Read Secret API and retrieve the secret value. The request varies depending on the secrets engine version you're using.
      {{site.base_gateway}} will parse the response of the read secret API automatically and return the secret value.

## What is a Vault?

Vaults allow you to securely store and then reference secrets from within other entities. This ensures that secrets aren't visible in plaintext throughout the platform, in places such as `kong.conf`,
declarative configuration files, logs, or the UI.

For example, you could store a certificate and a key in a Vault, then reference them from a [Certificate entity](/gateway/entities/certificate/). This way, the certificate and key are not stored in the entity directly and are more secure.

## How do I add secrets to a Vault?

You can add secrets to Vaults in one of the following ways:
* Environment variables
* {{site.konnect_short_name}} Config Store
* Supported third-party backend vault

## What can be stored as a secret?

You can store and reference the following as secrets in a Vault:

* All [`kong.conf` values](/gateway/manage-kong-conf/)<sup>1</sup>. For example:
  * Data store usernames and passwords, used with PostgreSQL and Redis
  * Private X.509 certificates
* Certificates and keys stored in the [Certificate {{site.base_gateway}} entity](/gateway/entities/certificate/)
* [{{site.base_gateway}} license](/gateway/entities/license/)<sup>2</sup>
* Referenceable plugin fields, such as third-party API keys (see table below for all values)

{:.info}
> **{{site.konnect_short_name}} Config Store limitations:**
> * <sup>1</sup>: You can't reference secrets stored in a [{{site.konnect_short_name}} Config Store](/how-to/configure-the-konnect-config-store/) Vault in `kong.conf` because {{site.konnect_short_name}} resolves the secret after {{site.base_gateway}} connects to the control plane.
> * <sup>2</sup>: In Konnect, the {{site.base_gateway}} license is managed and stored by {{site.konnect_short_name}}, and doesn't need to be stored manually in any Vault.

### Referenceable plugin fields

The following plugin fields can be stored and referenced as secrets:

## Supported Vault backends

Each vault has its own required configuration. You can provide this configuration by creating a Vault entity, or by configuring specific environment variables before starting {{ site.base_gateway }}.

## How do I reference secrets stored in a Vault?

When you want to use a secret stored in a Vault, you can reference the secret with a `vault` reference. You can use the `vault` reference in places such as `kong.conf`, declarative configuration files, logs, or in the UI.

The Vault backend may store multiple related secrets inside an object, but the reference
should always point to a key that resolves to a string value. For example, the following reference:

```
{vault://hcv/pg/username}
```

Would point to a secret object called `pg` inside a HashiCorp Vault, which may return the following value:

```json
{
  "username": "john",
  "password": "doe"
}
```

<!-- vale off -->
{{site.base_gateway}} receives the payload and extracts the `"username"` value of `"john"` for the secret reference of
`{vault://hcv/pg/username}`.
<!-- vale on -->

Vault references must be used for the whole referenced value. 
Imagine that you're calling a service application with the authentication token `ABC123`:

{% feature_table %}

columns:
  - title: Configuration Value
    key: config
  - title: Vault Value
    key: vault
features:
  - title: ❌
    config: 'Bearer {vault://hcv/myservice-auth-token}'
    vault: ABC123
  - title: ✅
    config: '{vault://hcv/myservice-auth-token}'
    vault: Bearer ABC123
{% endfeature_table %}

## Secret rotation in Vaults

By default, {{site.base_gateway}} automatically refreshes secrets *once every minute* in the background. 
You can also configure how often {{site.base_gateway}} refreshes secrets using the Vault entity configuration.

There are two types of refresh configuration available:
* Refresh periodically using TTLs: For example, check for a new TLS certificate once per day.
* Refresh on failure: For example, on a database authentication failure, check if the secrets were updated, and try again.

For more information, see [Secret management](/gateway/secrets-management/).

## Schema

The Vault entity can only be used once the database is initialized. Secrets for values that are used before the database is initialized can’t make use of the Vaults entity.

{% entity_schema %}

## Vault provider-specific configuration parameters

When you set up a Vault, each provider has specific parameters that you can or must configure to integrate the Vault entity with a provider.
