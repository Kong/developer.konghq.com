## What is a Group?


In {{site.base_gateway}}, the Group entity functions as a resource for [RBAC](/gateway/entities/rbac/#role-configuration). {{site.base_gateway}} admins can map permissions and Roles to a Group, and use the Group to simplify role assignment accross the {{site.base_gateway}} environment. The groupâ€™s resource can also be used to integrate IDPs like [Okta](/plugins/okta/) with Kong Manager allowing mapping of relationships between your service directory mappings and Kong Manager Roles.


## Service directory mapping

With Service directory mapping, Groups are mapped to [RBAC Roles](/gateway/entities/rbac/#role-configuration/). When a user logs in to Kong Manager, they are identified with their Admin username and authenticated with the user credentials in a service directory, like [LDAP](/plugins/ldap-auth/). The service directory creates a relationship with the associated RBAC Roles that are defined in {{site.base_gateway}}. This follows the following steps: 


1. Roles are created in {{site.base_gateway}}.
2. Groups are created and associated with RBAC Roles
3. Groups are associated with a directory
4. Permissions will be assigned to {{site.base_gateway}} users based on Group assignment.

For more information, read the [LDAP](/plugins/ldap-auth/) documentation.


## Schema

{% entity_schema %}

## Create a group

Creating an RBAC user requires RBAC to be enabled for {{site.base_gateway}}, for instructions on how to do that see [Enable RBAC](/gateway/entities/#enable-rbac).

{% entity_example %}
type: group

  name: my-group
