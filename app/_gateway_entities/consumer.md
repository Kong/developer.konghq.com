faqs:
  - q: What are credentials, and why do I need them?
    a: |
      Credentials are necessary to authenticate Consumers via various authentication mechanisms.
      The credential type depends on which authentication plugin you want to use.

      For example, a Key Authentication plugin requires an API key, and a Basic Authentication plugin requires a username and password pair.

  - q: What is the difference between Consumers and Applications?
    a: |
      Applications provide developers the ability to get access to APIs managed by {{site.base_gateway}} or {{site.konnect_short_name}} with no interaction from the Kong admin team to generate the required credentials. Applications are managed using the Developer Portal.

      With Consumers, the Kong team creates Consumers, generates credentials, and shares them with the developers that need access to the APIs.

  - q: What is the difference between Consumers and Developers?
    a: |
      A developer is a person that has registered for a Developer Portal. They can create applications and manage credentials themselves.

      Consumers are a part of your {{ site.base_gateway }} configuration and are managed by your administrators.

  - q: What is the difference between Consumers and RBAC Users?
    a: |
      RBAC Users are users of Kong Manager, whereas Consumers are users of the services proxied by the Gateway itself.

  - q: Which plugins can be scoped to Consumers?
    a: |
      Most plugins can be scoped to Consumers, with the exception of authentication plugins and plugins that control routing.

      You can see the full list in the [plugin scopes compatibility reference](/gateway/entities/plugin/#supported-scopes-by-plugin).

  - q: Can you scope authentication plugins to Consumers?
    a: |
      No. Authentication plugins must be scoped to either a Route, Service, or globally.

  - q: Can you manage Consumers with decK?
    a: |
      Yes, you can manage Consumers using decK, but take caution if you have a large number of Consumers as the sync time will be high.

      To manage a large number of consumers using decK, we recommend a federated configuration management approach where consumers are placed in to Consumer Groups and managed separately from the rest of your configuration.

## What is a Consumer?

A Consumer is an entity that consumes or uses the APIs managed by {{site.base_gateway}}.
Consumers can be applications, services, or users who interact with your APIs.
Since they are not always human, {{site.base_gateway}} calls them Consumers, because they "consume" the service.
{{site.base_gateway}} allows you to define and manage Consumers, apply access control policies, and monitor their API usage.

Consumers are essential for controlling access to your APIs, tracking usage, and ensuring security.
They are identified by key authentication, OAuth, or other authentication and authorization mechanisms.
For example, adding a Basic Auth plugin to a Gateway Service or Route allows it to identify a Consumer, or block access if credentials are invalid.

By attaching a plugin directly to a Consumer, you can manage specific controls at the Consumer level, such as rate limits.

## Use cases for Consumers

Common use cases for Consumers:

|Use case | Description|
|---------|------------|
| Authentication | Client authentication is the most common reason for setting up a Consumer. If you're using an authentication plugin, you'll need a Consumer with credentials. |
| Rate limiting | Rate limit specific Consumers based on tiers. |
| Transformation | Add or remove values from response bodies based on the Consumer. |
