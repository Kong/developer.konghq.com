[APIOps](/deck/apiops/) is the practice of applying DevOps and GitOps principles to the API lifecycle. It is the application
of process automation and tools that enable teams to manage APIs in a more efficient and repeatable way. 
The [{{site.konnect_short_name}} Reference Platform](/konnect-reference-platform) uses APIOps to automate the 
delivery of APIs to {{site.konnect_short_name}} in an verifiable, consistent, and repeatable manner.

Currently the {{site.konnect_short_name}} Reference Platform supports GitHub Actions for APIOps workflows. In future versions
we will explore support for other popular CI/CD tools.

### How are the APIOps workflows deployed?

The GitHub Actions workflow files are can be installed by the 
[{{site.konnect_short_name}} Orchestrator](/konnect-reference-platform/orchestrator) 
to a central platform repository. The process of initializing the platform repository is covered in the 
[how-to guide](/konnect-reference-platform/how-to/).

### How do API specifications flow through the Reference Platform?

Currently, API Specifications are copied from service repositories to the platform repository
by the {{site.konnect_short_name}} Orchestrator. This is by design to allow onboarding new services to 
the platform easily and without disruption to service application teams. In future versions of the reference platform, 
we will explore extended federated approaches to API specification management.

During the orchestrators reconciliation loop, it will check for changes to API specifications
in the configured service repositories and stage changed specifications to the platform repository as a PR. 
When these PRs are reviewed and approved by platform administrators, the APIOps workflows are triggered.

### What are the workflows in the Konnect Reference Platform?

There are 3 main workflows used to deliver APIs to {{site.base_gateway}}. These workflows are completed in
sequence, with administrator approval between each step. Completion of final workflow results in a deployed
API to {{site.konnect_saas}}.

* [OpenAPI to Kong](https://github.com/KongAirlines/platform/blob/main/.github/workflows/konnect-spec-to-deck.yaml): 
  This workflow takes an OpenAPI specification and converts it to 
  a [decK](/deck/) file that can be used by {{site.base_gateway}}. Additionally, service specific patches are
  applied to the decK file allowing administrators to set overrides for specific APIs.
* [Stage decK changes](https://github.com/KongAirlines/platform/blob/main/.github/workflows/konnect-stage-deck-change.yaml): 
  This workflow takes the decK file generated by the OpenAPI to Kong workflow
  and compares it to the current state of the {{site.base_gateway}}. It generates a diff and stages the changes
  as a PR. 
* [decK sync](https://github.com/KongAirlines/platform/blob/main/.github/workflows/konnect-deck-sync.yaml): 
  This workflow is triggered by the merging of deck configuration files to the main branch (by the previous workflow PR approval).
  The workflow triggers a `deck gateway sync` command on the configuration files and applies the changes to {{site.base_gateway}}.

Additionally, the reference platform supports API conformance checks to ensure that specifications are 
following governance controls and best practices. This is done using the 
[decK conformance workflow](https://github.com/KongAirlines/platform/blob/main/.github/workflows/konnect-lint-deck.yaml). 
These conformance workflows are run on PRs that contain changes to API specifications and deck configuration files. 

You can see examples of these workflows in action in the [Kong Airlines example project](https://github.com/KongAirlines/platform/actions).

### How do the workflows work and interact with each other?

The workflows are triggered by changes to files in the platform repository. The workflows are coded to 
only run when specific files have changed. When the orchestrator updates an API Specification file, the initial
workflow is ran, staging changes to the platform repository. The administrators only need to review and approve the
PRs created by the sequenced workflows to ensure a correct and successful deployment to {{site.base_gateway}}.

The following diagram shows details and sequencing on the APIOps workflows.

### What about organizations and environments 

The {{site.konnect_short_name}} Reference Platform supports multiple organizations and environments.
When the orchestrator copies API specifications from service repositories to the platform repository, it will
place them into a directory structure that follows this pattern:

`/konnect/<organization>/envs/<environment>/teams/<team>/services/<service-path>/openapi.yaml`

APIOps workflows are configured with an API Key that grants them access to 
individual {{site.konnect_short_name}} organizations. Every environment gets it's own set of
Control Planes (one per team). The APIOps workflows use this well known file structure to 
target the proper organization, environment, and team's Control Plane for configuration. 

### What's next?

You can follow a step-by-step [how-to guide](/konnect-reference-platform/how-to) to 
implement your own usage of the reference platform. The [FAQ](/konnect-reference-platform/faq/)
also has answers to many questions you have before proceeding with a full installation.
