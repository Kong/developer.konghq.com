A software bill of materials (SBOM) is an inventory of all software components (proprietary and open source), open source licenses, and dependencies in a given product. A software bill of materials provides visibility into the software supply chain and any license compliance, security, and quality risks that may exist.

Kong provides SBOMs for both Inso CLI binaries and Docker container images.
