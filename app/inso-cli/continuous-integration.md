Inso CLI is designed to run in a Continuous Integration (CI) environment. It disables prompts and provides exit codes to pass or fail the CI workflow.

You can use [Setup Inso](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/setup-inso) to perform Inso CLI tasks in your GitHub Actions.

1. Checks out branch

3. Runs linting
4. Runs unit tests
