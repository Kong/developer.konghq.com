## Contextual developer application analytics

Developers can view analytics for authenticated traffic from their registered applications within the {{site.konnect_short_name}} Dev Portal. These metrics help developers monitor usage patterns and understand how different APIs are being consumed.

Each application has its own dashboard, which provides a high-level summary of the **Number of Requests**, **Average Error Rate**, and **Latency**, and charts for the following data points:

* Requests by API
* Latency by API
* Error code distribution

{:.info}
> All of these metrics can be viewed within a selected time frame of up to 90 days and are available exclusively to customers with [Advanced Analytics](/advanced-analytics/).
