### kong.upstream.find_upstream
A span capturing the attempt to verify a specific upstream. 
Kong attempts to open a TCP connection (if not KeepAlive cache is found), do a TLS handshake and send down the HTTP headers. 
If all of this succeeds, the upstream is healthy and Kong will finish sending the full request and wait for a response. 
If any of the step fails, Kong will switch to the next target and try again.
