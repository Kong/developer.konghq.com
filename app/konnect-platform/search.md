{{site.konnect_short_name}} Search allows you to perform basic and advanced searches across all {{site.konnect_short_name}} entities within an organization. 
You can access search using the search bar (_Command+K_) at the top of every page in {{site.konnect_short_name}} or using the [{{site.konnect_short_name}} Search API](/api/konnect/ksearch/).

The {{site.konnect_short_name}} Search, by default, searches for both global and regional entities (with regional-awareness for the [currently selected region](/konnect-platform/geos/)). This ensures that returned entities are relevant to their geographical location. By default, every search performs:
* A global resources fetch for global {{site.konnect_short_name}} entities, such as users, teams, and networks
* A geo-scoped fetch, searching through [entities](/gateway/entities/) in the current {{site.konnect_short_name}} geo. For example, if you've selected the US geo, {{site.konnect_short_name}} search will only search for entities in the US geo.

Here are a few example use cases where you can use the {{site.konnect_short_name}} Search capabilities:

{% table %}
columns:
  - title: You want to...
    key: use_case
  - title: Then use...
    key: method
rows:
  - use_case: Navigate to a specific entity that you know exists
    method: |
      Click the **Basic** tab and search for the name or keywords of the entity in the {{site.konnect_short_name}} search bar to quickly navigate the various pages in {{site.konnect_short_name}}.
  - use_case: |
      Find entities that are "not compliant"
    method: |
      You can use search to find all entities that don't comply with your rules, such as all Routes that don't have a path that starts with `/api`.
{% endtable %}

## Query syntax

{{site.konnect_short_name}} Search provides selectors, reserved characters, and logical operators that you can use to narrow your entity search. 
By combining these selectors, reserved characters, and logical operators, you can construct complex and precise queries to effectively use {{site.konnect_short_name}} Search.

To perform a basic search, click the **Basic** tab. You can search for a known entity, like a Service, API, or team, using basic search. 

You can also perform an advanced search by clicking the **Advanced** tab and using {{site.konnect_short_name}}'s query syntax to get more granular results.

The following is an example advanced search query syntax:

```
type:team AND NOT label.department:eng AND name:*_qa
```

In this example, the query syntax is made up of the following components:
* Selectors: `type`, `label`, and `name`. They define what you are searching by. 
* Entity type: `team`. These define what {{site.konnect_short_name}} entity you want to search for.
* Logical operator: `AND NOT` and `AND`. These are used to combine multiple criteria in a query.
* Wildcard: `*` to denote any a suffix match.
* Search values: `eng` and `_qa`. These are the values that the search service is matching for.

{% endhttp_request %}

#### Searchable attributes

For each entity type, there is a list of entity specific attributes that are searchable. 
These attributes are returned in the attributes object in the search response, while the schema of the searchable attributes can be found in the `/types` endpoint.

### Selectors

Selectors are used to define the criteria of the search. 
The following table describes the different selectors and their functions:
