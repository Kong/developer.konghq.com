faqs:
  - q: Can I use automation to configure CMEK in {{site.konnect_short_name}}?
    a: Yes, you can use the {{site.konnect_short_name}} UI, API, and [Terraform](/terraform/) to configure CMEK.
  - q: Can I bring in symmetric keys from other key management services?
    a: No. CMEK currently only supports AWS Key Management Service (KMS).

{{site.konnect_short_name}} supports **Customer-Managed Encryption Keys (CMEK)**, allowing you to use your own symmetric key stored in **AWS Key Management Service (KMS)** to encrypt a pre-determined set of sensitive data. This feature enhances privacy, security, and regulatory compliance by enabling customer-controlled encryption.


## Benefits of CMEK

* **Regulatory compliance** with standards such as HIPAA, GDPR, and PCI-DSS
* **Exclusive decryption access** Encrypted data can't be accessed without a key.
* **Instant revocation** removing the key from AWS KMS makes encrypted data in {{site.konnect_short_name}} unreadable

## CMEK scope in {{site.konnect_short_name}}

CMEK currently applies to:

* Payloads captured through [the {{site.konnect_short_name}} Debugger](/gateway/debugger/)
* Request logs stored in Debugger workflows
* Data stored in Konnect Vault. Note: for CMEK should be uploaded before a control plane is created for the CMEK to encrypt the data stored in Konnect vault.

## Configure CMEK

Configuring CMEK consists of creating a symmetric encryption key in AWS KMS and providing the key ARN to {{site.konnect_short_name}}.

### Prerequisites

To configure CMEK, you need:
* A **symmetric key** in AWS KMS
* **Org Admin** role in {{site.konnect_short_name}}

### Create a symmetric encryption key in AWS KMS

1. In AWS, [create a **symmetric encryption key** in AWS KMS.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/create-keys.html):

1. Provision a new multi-region symmetric key in your AWS account using "Key Managed Service (KMS)". They key should be in the AWS region you intend to use in {{site.konnect_short_name}}. A multi-region key is recommended to replicate the key in multiple regions, which can be used for disaster recovery or compliance purposes. 

1. Ensure the following access policy statement is included in your key policy to allow `cc-konnect` role ({{site.konnect_short_name}}) to use your key:
```json
{
  "Effect": "Allow",
  "Principal": {
    "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::333402130851:role/cc-konnect"
  },
  "Action": [
    "kms:Encrypt",
    "kms:Decrypt",
    "kms:ReEncrypt*",
    "kms:GetKeyRotationStatus",
    "kms:GenerateDataKey*",
    "kms:DescribeKey"
  ],
  "Resource": "*"
}
```

3. Ensure the multi-region key is replicated to all AWS regions that make up a [{{site.konnect_short_name}} region](/konnect-platform/geos/).

### Configure CMEK in {{site.konnect_short_name}}

1. In {{site.konnect_short_name}}, navigate to [**Encryption Keys**](https://cloud.konghq.com/global/organization/settings/encryption-keys/).
1. Click **Link key**.
1. Enter the **Name**, **Amazon Resource Name**, **description**, and **Region**. 
1. Click **Connect**. 

## User responsibilities

When you configure CMEK, you are responsible for the following:

* **Key rotation**: 
  * AWS KMS takes care of key rotation automatically. 
  * Manual rotation with a new ARN requires updating the key in {{site.konnect_short_name}}. If the key's ARN changes, data encrypted with the previous key cannot be decrypted in {{site.konnect_short_name}}.
* **Key revocation**: 
  * Revoking or deleting your key in AWS KMS renders associated data permanently unreadable.
* **Performance impact**: 
  * KMS-based decryption may introduce latency during access operations.
* **Feature limitations**: 
  * CMEK encrypted fields cannot be used in full-text search, filtering, or analytics.
  * Alerting features cannot inspect CMEK encrypted content.
* **Cost**: 
  * Any costs incurred in AWS KMS.


## Managing keys

See the following sections for information about how to manage CMEK keys.

### Key Rotation

* Rotating keys within AWS KMS (without changing the ARN) is supported automatically.
* If you change the ARN, you must update the key in {{site.konnect_short_name}} manually. 
  * Data encrypted with the previous key cannot be decrypted and will be lost.

### Key revocation

The following happens if the AWS KMS key is revoked:
* If the AWS KMS key is revoked or deleted, encrypted data becomes inaccessible.
* {{site.konnect_short_name}} will display decryption errors when this occurs.
