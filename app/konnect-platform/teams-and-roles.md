  - q: What is a team in {{site.konnect_short_name}}?
    a: A team is a group of users with access to the same roles. Teams allow assigning access to {{site.konnect_short_name}} resources based on roles.
  - q: What is a role in {{site.konnect_short_name}}?
    a: |
      A role defines predefined access to a particular resource or instances of a resource type. For example, API product roles can be scoped to a specific API product or all API products, while Control Plane roles can be scoped to a specific Control Plane or all Control Planes.
  - q: Can predefined teams in {{site.konnect_short_name}} be modified or deleted?
    a: No, predefined teams have fixed role sets that cannot be modified or deleted.
  - q: I have the `API Products Publisher` role for the API product I want to publish, why don't I see any classic Dev Portals that I can publish to?
    a: To publish API products to a classic Dev Portal, you need at least a `Viewer` role for Dev Portal in addition to the `API Products Publisher` role.
  - q: My team has a Dev Portal, why can't I see APIs?
    a: You need additional permissions to see APIs. See the [Catalog APIs roles](/konnect-platform/teams-and-roles/#catalog-apis) for more information.

To help secure and govern your environment, {{site.konnect_short_name}} provides
the ability to manage authorization with teams and roles. You can use {{site.konnect_short_name}}'s
predefined teams for a standard set of roles, or create custom teams with
any roles you choose. Invite users and add them to these teams to manage user
access.

You must either be a member of the Organization Admin team, or be assigned the
Identity Admin role, to manage users, teams, and roles.

{:.info}
> **Note:** If the Okta integration is [enabled](/konnect-platform/sso/),
{{site.konnect_short_name}} users and teams become read-only. An organization
admin can view all registered users in {{site.konnect_short_name}}, but cannot
edit their team membership from the {{site.konnect_short_name}} side. To manage
automatically-created users, adjust user permissions through Okta, or
[adjust team mapping](/konnect-platform/sso/).

## Access precedence

Users can be part of any number of teams, and the roles gained from the teams
are additive. For example, if you add a user to both the Service Developer and
Portal Viewer teams, the user can create and manage Services
through API Products _and_ register applications through the Dev Portal.

If two roles provide access to the same [entity](/gateway/entities/), the role with more access
takes effect. For example, if you have the Service Admin and Service Deployer
roles on the same Service, the Service Admin role takes precedence.

## Geographic region assignment

Teams and roles can be assigned to a specific [geographic region](/konnect-platform/geos/) in {{site.konnect_short_name}}. Those teams and roles only access {{site.konnect_short_name}} objects, such as Services, that are also located in the same geo they are assigned to.

## Teams

A team is a group of users with access to the same roles. Teams are useful
for assigning access by functionality, where they can provide granular access to
any group of {{site.konnect_short_name}} resources based on roles.

You can create and manage teams by navigating to [**Organization**](https://cloud.konghq.com/organization/) > **Teams** in {{site.konnect_short_name}}.

### Predefined teams

All new and existing organizations in {{site.konnect_short_name}} have predefined default teams. The default teams can't be modified or deleted.

{% endtable %} 

### Create a custom team

Custom teams let organizations manage user access by grouping roles and permissions. 

Any user added to a custom team automatically inherits all roles assigned to that team.

To create and configure a custom team:

1. Create the team  
   Send a `POST` request to the [`/teams` endpoint](/api/konnect/identity/#/operations/create-team) with the `name` and `description` in the request body. Save the `team_id` from the response.

1. Assign roles to the team  
   Send a `POST` request to the [`/assigned-roles` endpoint](/api/konnect/identity/#/operations/teams-assign-role) to grant the team specific roles.

1. Add users to the team  
   To give a user access to the teamâ€™s roles, you must assign them to the team.  
   Send a `POST` request to the [`/users` endpoint](/api/konnect/identity/#/operations/add-user-to-team). Users can belong to multiple teams and inherit roles from each.
 
1. (Optional) Enable group-to-team mappings  
   If [single sign-on (SSO)](/konnect-platform/sso/) is enabled, you can configure {{site.konnect_short_name}} to automatically map users to teams based on group claims from your IdP. To do this, send a `PUT` request to the [`/team-mappings` endpoint](/api/konnect/identity/#/operations/update-idp-team-mappings) with `team_ids` in the request body.

#### Dev Portal custom teams
