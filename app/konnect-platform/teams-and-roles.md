To help secure and govern your environment, {{site.konnect_short_name}} provides
the ability to manage authorization with teams and roles. You can use {{site.konnect_short_name}}'s
predefined teams for a standard set of roles, or create custom teams with
any roles you choose. Invite users and add them to these teams to manage user
access.

You must be part of the Organization Admin team to manage users, teams, and
roles.

{:.info}
> **Note:** If the Okta integration is [enabled](/konnect-platform/sso/),
{{site.konnect_short_name}} users and teams become read-only. An organization
admin can view all registered users in {{site.konnect_short_name}}, but cannot
edit their team membership from the {{site.konnect_short_name}} side. To manage
automatically-created users, adjust user permissions through Okta, or
[adjust team mapping](/konnect-platform/sso/).

## Access precedence

Users can be part of any number of teams, and the roles gained from the teams
are additive. For example, if you add a user to both the Service Developer and
Portal Viewer teams, the user can create and manage Services
through API Products _and_ register applications through the Dev Portal.

If two roles provide access to the same [entity](/gateway/entities/), the role with more access
takes effect. For example, if you have the Service Admin and Service Deployer
roles on the same Service, the Service Admin role takes precedence.

## Geographic region assignment

Teams and roles can be assigned to a specific [geographic region](/konnect-platform/geos/) in {{site.konnect_short_name}}. Those teams and roles only access {{site.konnect_short_name}} objects, such as Services, that are also located in the same geo they are assigned to.

## Teams

A team is a group of users with access to the same roles. Teams are useful
for assigning access by functionality, where they can provide granular access to
any group of {{site.konnect_short_name}} resources based on roles.

You can create and manage teams by navigating to [**Organization**](https://cloud.konghq.com/organization/) > **Teams** in {{site.konnect_short_name}}.

### Predefined teams

All new and existing organizations in {{site.konnect_short_name}} have predefined default teams. The default teams can't be modified or deleted.

### Create a custom team

Custom teams let organizations manage user access by grouping roles and permissions. 

Any user added to a custom team automatically inherits all roles assigned to that team.

To create and configure a custom team:

1. Create the team  
   Send a `POST` request to the [`/teams` endpoint](/api/konnect/identity/#/operations/create-team) with the `name` and `description` in the request body. Save the `team_id` from the response.

1. Assign roles to the team  
   Send a `POST` request to the [`/assigned-roles` endpoint](/api/konnect/identity/#/operations/teams-assign-role) to grant the team specific roles.

1. Add users to the team  
   To give a user access to the teamâ€™s roles, you must assign them to the team.  
   Send a `POST` request to the [`/users` endpoint](/api/konnect/identity/#/operations/add-user-to-team). Users can belong to multiple teams and inherit roles from each.
 
1. (Optional) Enable group-to-team mappings  
   If [single sign-on (SSO)](/konnect-platform/sso/) is enabled, you can configure {{site.konnect_short_name}} to automatically map users to teams based on group claims from your IdP. To do this, send a `PUT` request to the [`/team-mappings` endpoint](/api/konnect/identity/#/operations/update-idp-team-mappings) with `team_ids` in the request body.

## Roles

Roles predefine access to a particular resource, or
instances of a particular resource type (for example, API product roles can be scoped to a particular API product or all API products while Control Plane roles can be scoped to a particular Control Plane or all Control Planes).

You can manage a user's roles by navigating to [**Organization**](https://cloud.konghq.com/organization/) > **Users** in {{site.konnect_short_name}} and clicking the **Role Assignments** tab for a user.
