  Kong Identity enables customers to use {{site.konnect_short_name}} to generate, authenticate and authorize API access. Kong Identity implements the OAuth2.0 standard with OpenID Connect for authentication and authorization. 

faqs:
  - q: How does the authorization code flow work with Kong Identity?
    a: |
      In the authorization code flow:
      1. The **client application** displays the user consent page and authenticates the user (this part is handled outside Kong).
      2. When the user clicks "Authorize," the client app calls the `/authorize` endpoint created by attaching the OAuth2 plugin to a service.
      3. The request includes the client ID, secret, and scopes the user consented to.
      4. The **authorization server** (Kong Gateway with OAuth2 plugin) validates the client credentials and returns an **authorization code**.
      5. The client exchanges this code at the `/accesstoken` endpoint for access tokens.
      6. The access token is used to call protected APIs.
      7. When the API call is made, the **introspection plugin** validates the token with the Identity Provider (IdP), identifies the associated consumer, and adds `x-consumer-*` headers to the upstream request.

  - q: How do I retrieve my clientâ€™s secret again?
    a: |
      To retrieve your client secret, you must access the credentials stored in the service or plugin configuration. 
      If the secret was not saved securely by the client application, you may need to generate a new secret through the Kong Admin API or relevant client management interface.

## Glossary 
{% table %}
columns:
  - title: Term

  - title: Definition
    key: definition
rows:
  - term: Authorization Server
    definition: >
      Auth Servers generate OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect tokens. The Konnect Management API allows you to create, configure, and manage multiple Auth Servers per Konnect organization. Auth Servers are regional Konnect entities. They also provide the option to manage "claims" and "scopes" for clients.
  - term: Client
    definition: >
      The machine entity that requests tokens for authentication. Clients belong to auth servers. Clients represent the identity of machines, such as microservices, mobile apps, or scripts for Kong Gateway use cases.
  - term: Token
    definition: >
      A short-lived token for a client, generated by Kong Identity, used in the OAuth and OIDC flows. This token authenticates the machine to the application, and the claims authorize the client. The token does not contain any credential information. A JWT token is minted by the auth server.
