Kong Identity enables you to use {{site.konnect_short_name}} to generate, authenticate, and authorize API access. 
Specifically, Kong Identity can be used for machine-to-machine authentication. 

You can use Kong Identity to:
* Create authorization servers per region
* Issue and validate access tokens
* Integrate secure authentication into your {{site.base_gateway}} APIs 

Kong Identity implements the OAuth2.0 standard with OpenID Connect for authentication and authorization. Kong Identity can be used with the following Kong plugins:
* [OpenID Connect plugin](/plugins/openid-connect/)
* [OAuth2.0 Introspection plugin](/plugins/oauth2-introspection/)
* [Upstream OAuth plugin](/plugins/upstream-oauth/)

## How Kong Identity works

Kong Identity allows you to create auth servers, claims, scopes, and clients in {{site.konnect_short_name}} using the [{{site.konnect_short_name}} API](/api/konnect/kong-identity/v1/#/). Each of these components plays a specific role in how access is managed:
* **Auth server:** Issue OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect tokens that you can use to authenticate a client (machine) with your Gateway Services. Each auth server is unique to your organization and [{{site.konnect_short_name}} region](/konnect-platform/geos/). We recommend creating different auth servers for different environments or subsidiaries.
* **Clients:** Represent machines that request tokens, such as microservices, mobile apps, or automation scripts.
* **Scopes:** Define what those clients are allowed to access. 
* **Claims:** Optional pieces of metadata, like user roles or environment tags, that can be included in tokens and forwarded to upstream services.

To use Kong Identity for authentication, you must configure one of the supported plugins (OpenID Connect, OAuth2.0 Introspection, or Upstream OAuth). These plugins determine how tokens are validated, introspected, or passed along to upstream services.

## Kong Identity client credential authentication flow

## Kong Identity authorization code flow

In the authorization code flow:
1. (Optional) The client application displays the user consent page and authenticates the user (this part is handled outside {{site.base_gateway}}). When the user clicks **Authorize**, the client app calls the `/authorize` endpoint created by attaching the OAuth2 plugin to a service.

   {:.info}
   > If an app requires user authentication, the authorization step must happen outside of {{site.konnect_short_name}}.
   
3. The client makes a request that includes the client ID, secret, and scopes the user consented to.
4. The authorization server ({{site.base_gateway}} with OAuth2 plugin) validates the client credentials and returns an authorization code.
5. The client exchanges this code at the `/oauth/token` endpoint for access tokens.
6. The client uses the access token to call protected APIs.

## Kong Consumer Group plugin flow
In the consumer group plugin flow:
1. In **{{site.konnect_short_name}} > API Gateway > Consumers**, the client creates the consumer. Each user that needs access is represented as a consumer.

   {:.info}
   > If using OIDC, you donâ€™t need to manually map credentials. The OIDC plugin automatically maps clients to consumers based on token claims.
2. The client defines the required Consumer Groups in {{site.konnect_short_name}}, and then applies the desired plugin at the consumer group scope.
3. The client assigns each consumer to the appropriate consumer group. Once assigned, the plugin configuration at the group level automatically applies to the consumer.

## Dynamic claim templates

You can configure dynamic claim templates to generate custom claims during runtime. These JWT claim values can be rendered as any of the following types:
* Strings 
* Integers
* Floats
* Booleans
* JSON object or arrays

The type is inferred from the value. 

JWT claim values can also be templated with contextual data and functions. Dynamic values must use `${}` as templating boundaries.

Claims support templating via the context passed to the client during the authentication, in the following format:

```json
{
  "AuthServer": {
    "ID": "uuid.UUID",
    "CreatedAt": "DateTime",
    "UpdatedAt": "DateTime",
    "Name": "string",
    "Description": "string",
    "Audience": "string",
    "SigningAlgorithm": "string",
    "Labels": {
      "key": "value"
    }
  },
  "Client": {
    "ID": "string",
    "CreatedAt": "DateTime",
    "UpdatedAt": "DateTime",
    "Name": "string",
    "Labels": {
      "key": "value"
    },
    "GrantTypes": [
      "string"
    ],
    "RedirectURIs": [
      "string"
    ],
    "LoginURI": "string",
    "ResponseTypes": [
      "string"
    ],
    "AllowAllScopes": true
  }
}
```

To test the templating, you can use the [`/v1/auth-servers/$authServerId/clients/$clientId/test-claim` endpoint](/api/konnect/kong-identity/v1/#/operations/testClaimForClient).
