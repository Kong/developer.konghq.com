Domain capture allows you to consolidate all Insomnia accounts in a specific domain into your Enterprise account.
To enable domain capture:

1. Add and verify a [domain](https://app.insomnia.rest/app/enterprise/domains/list).
1. In the domain settings, click the toggle to enable domain capture.

{:.info}
> Domain capture can only be enabled on a verified domain.

Once domain capture is enabled, when a new user creates an Insomnia account with an email address in the domain, the user will be added to the enterprise account automatically.
