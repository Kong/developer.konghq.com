Use domain capture to automatically add new users to your Enterprise account when they sign up with a verified email domain.
To enable domain capture and auto-capture all new employees:
1. Add and verify a [domain](https://app.insomnia.rest/app/enterprise/domains/list).
1. In the domain settings, click the toggle to enable domain capture.

{:.info}
> You can enable domain capture on a verified domain only.

When you enable domain capture on a verified domain, all new users that create an Insomnia account with an email address in the domain are automatically added to the Enterprise account. For example:

- Kong uses @kong.com and enables Domain capture: When JoeSmith@kong.com signs up for Insomnia, the platform automatically adds JoeSmith@kong.com to the Enterprise license and lists the user on the licenses page.
