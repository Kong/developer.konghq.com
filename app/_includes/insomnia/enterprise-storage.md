In [**Enterprise Controls** > **Storage**](https://app.insomnia.rest/app/enterprise/storage), you can manage [storage options](/insomnia/storage/) for organizations and personal workspaces.

By default, all storage options are available. You can enforce storage options for all personal workspaces and organizations, but you can also set different storage options for each organization.
