Upstreams are automatically generated by Kong Ingress Controller based on the Kubernetes API server state.

Upstream behaviuour can be customized in KIC using the `KongUpstreamPolicy` resource:

```yaml
apiVersion: configuration.konghq.com/v1beta1
kind: KongUpstreamPolicy
metadata:
    name: sample-customization
{% if include.presenter.data.tags %}    konghq.com/tags: {{ include.presenter.data.tags | join:", " }}
{%- endif -%}
spec:
    algorithm: {{ include.presenter.data.algorithm }}
```

To use the upstream configuration, it needs to be associated with a `Service`:

```
kubectl patch service my-sample-service -p '{"metadata":{"annotations":{"konghq.com/upstream-policy":"sample-customization"}}}'
```
