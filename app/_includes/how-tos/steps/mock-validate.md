To validate, you can create a collection and import the requests from [KongAir Flights](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Kong/KongAir/refs/heads/main/flight-data/flights/openapi.yaml), then create a new environment with your mock URL as the base URL. When you send the `Get KongAir planned flights` request with the mock environment, you will get the response created in the mock route.
