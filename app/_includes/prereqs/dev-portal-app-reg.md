For this tutorial, you’ll need a Dev Portal and some Dev Portal settings, like a published API, pre-configured. These settings are essential for Dev Portal to function but configuring them isn’t the focus of this guide. If you don't have these settings already configured, follow these steps to pre-configure them:

1. [Create a Dev Portal](https://cloud.konghq.com/portals/create).
1. [Create an API](https://cloud.konghq.com/apis/create).
1. [Register a test developer account with your Dev Portal](/dev-portal/developer-signup/#1-register-or-sign-in). You can do this by navigating to your Dev Portal URL and clicking **Sign up**.
