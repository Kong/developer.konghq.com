To complete this tutorial, you'll need **Python (version 3.7 or later)** and `pip` installed on your machine. You can verify it by running:

```bash
python3
python3 -m pip --version
```

Once that's set up, install the required packages by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python3 -m pip install langchain langchain_text_splitters requests
```
