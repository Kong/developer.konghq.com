  If you don't already have Kong Gateway running, you can use the [quickstart script](https://get.konghq.com/quickstart) to get up and running quickly:
  ```bash
  curl -Ls https://get.konghq.com/quickstart | bash -s
  ```
  Once the Kong Gateway is ready, you will see the following message:
  ```bash
  Kong Gateway Ready 
  ```
