This guide requires a running Kubernetes cluster. If you already have a Kubernetes cluster running, you can skip this step. 
It can be a cluster running locally, like Docker, or in a public cloud like AWS EKS, GCP GKE, etc.

For example, if you are using [minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/):
```sh
minikube start -p mesh-zone
```
