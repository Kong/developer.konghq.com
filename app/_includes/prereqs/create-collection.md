For this tutorial, you'll need a collection in Insomnia. A collection is essential for this tutorial to function, but creating one isn't the focus of this guide. Use the following to add a pre-configured collection to Insomnia: 
    <a href="https://insomnia.rest/run/?label=Flights%20Service%200.1.0&uri=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FKong%2Fdeveloper.konghq.com%2Frefs%2Fheads%2Fmain%2Fapp%2Finsomnia%2FFlights-Service-0.1.0.yaml" target="_blank"><img src="https://insomnia.rest/images/run.svg" alt="Run in Insomnia"></a>

This pre-configured collection contains:
* The example "Flights Service 0.1.0" spec [added as a document](/how-to/create-a-design-document/)
* [A collection generated from the spec](/how-to/generate-a-collection-from-a-design-document/)
* Pre-configured base [environment variables](/insomnia/environments/)
