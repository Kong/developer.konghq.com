  decK is a CLI tool for managing {{site.base_gateway}} declaratively with state files.
  To complete this tutorial, install [decK](/deck/) **version 1.43** or later.

  This guide uses `deck gateway apply`, which directly applies entity configuration to your Gateway instance.
  We recommend upgrading your decK installation to take advantage of this tool.

  You can check your current decK version with `deck version`.
