[Hybrid mode](/gateway/hybrid-mode/) deployments consist of one or more Control Plane (CP) nodes, and one or more Data Plane (DP) nodes. 
CP nodes use a database to store {{site.base_gateway}} configuration data, whereas DP nodes don't, since they get all of the needed information from the CP.
The recommended upgrade process is a combination of different upgrade strategies for each type of node, CP or DP.

The major challenge with a Hybrid mode upgrade is the communication between the CP and DP. 
As Hybrid mode requires the minor version of the CP to be no less than that of the DP, you must upgrade CP nodes before DP nodes. 

The upgrade must be carried out in two phases:

1. Upgrade the CP according to the recommendations in the section [Traditional mode](#traditional-mode), 
while DP nodes are still serving API requests.
2. Upgrade DP nodes using the recommendations from the section [DB-less mode](#db-less-mode). 
Point the new DP nodes to the new CP to avoid version conflicts.

The role decoupling feature between CP and DP enables DP nodes to serve API requests while upgrading CP. 
With this method, there is no business downtime.

Custom plugins (either your own plugins or third-party plugins that are not shipped with {{site.base_gateway}})
need to be installed on both the Control Plane and the Data Planes in Hybrid mode. 
Install the plugins on the Control Plane first, and then the Data Planes.

See the following sections for a breakdown of the options for Hybrid mode deployments.

#### Control Planes

CP nodes must be upgraded before DP nodes. CP nodes serve an admin-only role and require database support. 
You can select from the same upgrade strategies nominated for Traditional mode (dual-cluster or in-place), 
as described in figure 2 and figure 3 respectively.

Upgrading the CP nodes using the [dual-cluster strategy](/gateway/upgrade/dual-cluster/):

> _Figure 3: The diagram shows a CP upgrade using the in-place strategy, where the current CP X is directly replaced by a new CP Y._
_The database is reused by the new CP Y, and the current CP X is shut down once all nodes are migrated._

From the two diagrams, you can see that DP nodes X remain connected to the current CP node X, or alternatively switch to the new CP node Y.
{{site.base_gateway}} guarantees that new minor versions of CPs are compatible with old minor versions of the DP, 
so you can temporarily point DP nodes X to the new CP node Y.
This lets you pause the upgrade process if needed, or conduct it over a longer period of time.

{:.warning}
> This setup is meant to be temporary, to be used only during the upgrade process.
> We do not recommend running a combination of new versions of CP nodes and old versions of DP nodes in a long-term production deployment.

After the CP upgrade, cluster X can be decommissioned. You can delay this task to the very end of the DP upgrade.

#### Data Planes

Once the CP nodes are upgraded, you can move on to upgrade the DP nodes. 
The only supported upgrade strategy for DP upgrades is the rolling upgrade.
The following diagrams, figure 4 and 5, are the counterparts of figure 2 and 3 respectively.
