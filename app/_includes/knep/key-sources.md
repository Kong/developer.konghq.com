You must define a key for the {{include.name}} policy. This policy supports the following key sources:
* AWS (`aws`): An AWS key vault.
* Static (`static`): An array of explicitly defined [static keys](/event-gateway/entities/static-key/).

<!-- Where do key sources get defined? Does it need to be a vault? -->
