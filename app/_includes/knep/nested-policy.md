This policy can be applied directly to the virtual cluster, or be nested within a Schema Validation policy.
See the [policy nesting example](/event-gateway/policies/{{include.slug}}/nested-policy/) to learn how to apply a {{include.name}} policy to a parent.

Nested policies are sorted into an index. You can re-order nested policies within the parent policy by adjusting this index. 
See the reference for [nested policies](/event-gateway/entities/policy/#policy-nesting) for more detail.
