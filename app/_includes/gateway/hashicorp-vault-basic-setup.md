1. In a new terminal, start HashiCorp Vault:
   ```sh
   vault server -config=./vault/config.hcl
   ```

1. In your previous terminal, set the Vault address:
   ```sh
   export VAULT_ADDR="http://localhost:8200"
   ```

1. Initialize the Vault:
   ```sh
   vault operator init -key-shares=1 -key-threshold=1
   ```
   This outputs your unseal key and initial root token. Export them as environment variables:
   ```sh
   export HCV_UNSEAL_KEY='YOUR-UNSEAL-KEY'
   export DECK_HCV_TOKEN='YOUR-INITIAL-ROOT-TOKEN'
   ```

1. Unseal your Vault:
   ```sh
   vault operator unseal $HCV_UNSEAL_KEY
   ```

1. Log in to your Vault:
   ```sh
   vault login $DECK_HCV_TOKEN
   ```

1. Write the policy to access secrets:
   ```sh
   vault policy write rw-secrets ./vault/rw-secrets.hcl
   ```
