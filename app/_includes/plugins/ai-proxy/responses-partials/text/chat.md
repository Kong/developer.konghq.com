                "content": "The Boltzmann equation is a fundamental equation in statistical mechanics that describes how the distribution function f(x, v, t) of particles in a gas evolves over time. It accounts for the effects of particle collisions and external forces, providing a bridge between microscopic particle dynamics and macroscopic thermodynamic behavior. The general form of the equation is: ∂f/∂t + v · ∇f + F · ∇_v f = (∂f/∂t)_collision, where f is the distribution function, v is velocity, F is an external force, and the right-hand side represents the change in f due to collisions.",
