The following table describes each object in the log:

{% table %}
columns:
  - title: Log item
    key: log
  - title: Description
    key: description
rows:
  - log: "`service`"
    description: Properties of the Gateway Service associated with the requested Route.
  - log: "`route`"
    description: Properties of the specific Route requested.
  - log: "`request`"
    description: Properties of the request sent by the client.
  - log: "`request.tls.version`"
    description: TLS/SSL version used by the connection.
  - log: "`request.tls.cipher`"
    description: TLS/SSL cipher used by the connection.
  - log: "`request.tls.client_verify`"
    description: |
      mTLS validation result. Contents are the same as described in [$ssl_client_verify](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_ssl_module.html#var_ssl_client_verify).
  - log: "`response`"
    description: Properties of the response sent to the client.
  - log: "`latencies`"
    description: Latency data.
  - log: "`latencies.kong`"
    description: |
      The internal {{site.base_gateway}} latency, in milliseconds, that it takes to process the request.
      * For requests that are proxied to an upstream service, it is equivalent to the `X-Kong-Proxy-Latency` [response header](/gateway/configuration/#headers).
      * For requests that generate a response within {{ site.base_gateway }} (typically the result of an error or a plugin-generated response), it is equivalent to the `X-Kong-Response-Latency` [response header](/gateway/configuration/#headers).
      * In {{site.base_gateway}} 3.6 or earlier, it only consists of the time it took to find the right upstream service, receive the whole response from the upstream service, and run all plugins executed before the log phase.
  - log: "`latencies.request`"
    description: |
      The time, in milliseconds, that has elapsed between when the first bytes were read from the client and the last byte was sent to the client. 
      This is useful for detecting slow clients.
  - log: "`latencies.proxy`"
    description: |
      The time, in milliseconds, that it took for the upstream service to process the request. 
      In other words, it's the time elapsed between transferring the request to the final Service and when {{site.base_gateway}} starts receiving the response.
  - log: "`latencies.receive`"
    description: The time, in milliseconds, that it took to receive and process the response (headers and body) from the upstream service.
  - log: "`tries`"
    description: A list of iterations made by the load balancer for this request.
  - log: "`tries.balancer_start`"
    description: A Unix timestamp for when the balancer started.
  - log: "`tries.ip`"
    description: The IP address of the contacted balancer.
  - log: "`tries.port`"
    description: The port number of the contacted balancer.
  - log: "`tries.balancer_latency`"
    description: The latency of the balancer expressed in milliseconds.
  - log: "`client_ip`"
    description: The original client IP address.
  - log: "`workspace`"
    description: The UUID of the Workspace associated with this request.
  - log: "`workspace_name`"
    description: The name of the Workspace associated with this request.
  - log: "`upstream_uri`"
    description: The URI, including query parameters, for the configured upstream service.
  - log: "`authenticated_entity`"
    description: Properties of the authenticated credential. Only present if authentication is enabled.
  - log: "`consumer`"
    description: The authenticated Consumer. Only present if authentication is enabled.
  - log: "`started_at`"
    description: The Unix timestamp of when the request has started to be processed.
  - log: "`source`"
    description: |
      {% new_in 3.6 %} Indicates whether the response is generated by `kong` or `upstream`.
  - log: "`upstream_status`"
    description: |
      {% new_in 3.6 %} The status code received from the upstream service in the response.
{% endtable %}

Log plugins enabled on Services and Routes also contain information about the Service or Route.
