A managed cache for Dedicated Cloud Gateways is a Redis-compatible datastore that powers all Redis-enabled plugins. This is fully-managed by Kong in the regions and provider of your choice, so you don't have to host Redis infrastructure. Managed cache allows you get up and running faster with [Redis-backed plugins](/gateway/entities/partial/#use-partials), such as Proxy Caching, Rate Limiting, AI Rate Limiting, and ACME.
