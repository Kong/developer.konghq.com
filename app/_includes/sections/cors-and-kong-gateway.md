## Understanding CORS

For security purposes a browser will stop requests from accessing URLs on different domains. This is done using CORS, a set of rules for web applications that make requests across origin. CORS works by looking at the HTTP `origin` header of a URL and checking it against a list of allowed headers. An `origin` header can contain the `scheme`, `hostname`, or `port` of the requesting URL. Operations that are restricted to same-origin content can be managed using CORS.

When making a cross-origin request, browsers issue an `origin` request header, and servers must respond with a matching `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` (ACAO) header. If the two headers do not match, the browser will discard the response, and any application components that require that responseâ€™s data will not function properly.

For example, the following request and response pairs have matching CORS headers, and will succeed:

```sh
GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
Origin: http://example.net

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: http://example.net
```

```sh
GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
Origin: http://example.net

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
```

The requests do not have a matching CORS headers and therefore will fail: 

```sh
GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
Origin: http://example.net

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: http://badbadcors.example
```

```sh
GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
Origin: http://example.net

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
```

Missing CORS headers when CORS headers are expected results in failure.
