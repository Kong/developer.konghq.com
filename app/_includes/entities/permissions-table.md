### Default {{site.base_gateway}} roles

By default, when {{site.base_gateway}} is configured, the starting user is configured as a **Super Admin** in the `default` Workspace. Workspaces, by default, contain the following roles:

rows:
  - role: "`admin`"
    description: Full access to all endpoints, across all Workspaces, except the RBAC Admin API.
  - role: "`super-admin`"
    description: Full access to all endpoints, across all Workspaces, including the ability to assign and modify RBAC permissions.
  - role: "`read-only`"
    description: Read access to all endpoints, across all Workspaces.
{% endtable %}

An admin has full permissions to every endpoint in {{site.base_gateway}}, but they can't assign and modify RBAC permissions.

### Workspace roles

[Workspaces](/gateway/entities/workspace/) provide a way to logically segment configurations and entities with RBAC. Using RBAC, you can restrict access to groups of users and create roles within a Workspace so that users can manage each other. This is done using the [`workspaces/rbac/roles`](/api/gateway/admin-ee/#/operations/post-rbac-roles-workspace) endpoint.

  - role: "`workspace-admin`"
    description: Full access to all endpoints in the Workspace, except the RBAC Admin API.
  - role: "`workspace-super-admin`"
    description: Full access to all endpoints in the Workspaces, including the ability to assign and modify RBAC.
  - role: "`workspace-portal-admin`"
    description: Full access to Dev Portal related endpoints in the Workspace.
  - role: "`workspace-read-only`"
    description: Read access to all endpoints in the Workspace.
{% endtable %}

A role assigned in the `default` Workspace has permissions across all subsequently created Workspaces unless the roles in the specific Workplace are explicitly assigned. When a Workspace has explicitly assigned roles, they take precedent over the `default` Workspace. 

If RBAC roles and permissions are assigned from within a Workspace, they are specific to that Workspace. For example, if there are two Workspaces, Payments and Deliveries, an admin created in Payments doesnâ€™t have access to any endpoints in Deliveries.
