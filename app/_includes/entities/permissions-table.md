## Default {{site.base_gateway}} roles

By default, when {{site.base_gateway}} is configured, the starting user is configured as a **Super Admin** in the `default` Workspace. Workspaces, by default, contain the following roles: 

| Role      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| `admin` | Full access to all endpoints, across all Workspaces, except the RBAC Admin API  |
| `super-admin`   | Full access to all endpoints, across all Workspaces, ability to assign and modify RBAC permissions.     |
|`read-only`| Read access to all endpoints, across all Workspaces|

An **Admin** has full permissions to every endpoint in {{site.base_gateway}}, but they can't assign and modify RBAC permissions. An **Admin** can't modify their own permissions, or configure the permissions of the **Super Admin**.

## Workspace roles

[Workspaces](/gateway/entities/workspace/) provide a way to logically segment configurations and entities with RBAC. Using RBAC, you can restrict access to groups of users and create roles within a Workspace so that users can manage each other. This is done using the [`workspaces/rbac/roles`](/api/gateway/admin-ee/#/operations/post-rbac-roles-workspace) endpoint.  

| Role      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
|`workspace-admin` | Full access to all endpoints in the Workspace, except the RBAC Admin API.| 
|`Workspace-read-only` | Read access to all endpoints in the Workspace | 

A role assigned in the `default` Workspace has permissions across all subsequently created Workspaces unless the roles in the specific Workplace are explicitly assigned. When a Workspace has explicitly assigned roles, they take precedent over the `default` Workspace.
