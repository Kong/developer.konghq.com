        <h3>Rate Limiting in Kong Gateway</h3>
        <span>
            Kong Gateway can be configured to apply rate limiting rules on API traffic entering the system. This includes rate limiting by IP, API key, consumer, or other criteria. This is ideal for handling external API traffic with advanced rate limiting policies and comprehensive traffic management.
