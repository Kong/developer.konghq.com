When you're done experimenting with this example, clean up the resources:

1. If you created a new Event Gateway control plane and want to conserve your free trial credits or avoid unnecessary charges, delete the new [control plane](https://cloud.konghq.com/event-gateway/) used in this tutorial.

1. Stop and remove the containers:

   ```sh
   docker-compose down
   ```

This will stop all services and remove the containers, but preserve your configuration files for future use.
