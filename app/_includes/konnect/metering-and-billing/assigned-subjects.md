### Assigned subjects

Billable events ingested into OpenMeter always include a `subject`.  
Subjects represent usage-producing entities within your system.

A customer can have **one or many** subjects assigned, allowing you to group usage and billing.

Example scenario:

* A customer has multiple departments producing usage:  
  * `department1`  
  * `department2`
